Please outline the strategy you have adopted for your restaurant in order to succeed in competition. Consider factors such as selling more dishes at a lower cost or catering to a high-end clientele. It is crucial to find the right approach for your restaurant, as this is the first and most important aspect.

Please keep in mind the following rules:
1. Chefs:
  - You are not allowed to communicate with or train the chefs.
  - The level of a chef is directly proportional to their salary.
2. Dishes:
  - The taste of a dish is determined by its original price. If you wish to enhance the taste, you can adjust the original price to procure better ingredients.
  - The ratio of the cost price to the selling price of a dish impacts the customer's experience.
3. Advertisement:
  - The only available channel for advertising is the advertising module. If you wish to communicate with customers, you can only do so through this module.

So, please list the actions you want to perform, then do it on corresponding module.
