1. Action Space
Basic restaurant information, menu, chef, and advertisement.

2. Rules
Please keep in mind the following rules:
(1) Strategies
  - It is crucial to find the right approach for your restaurant, as this is the first and most important aspect. Consider factors such as selling more dishes at a lower cost, catering to a high-end clientele or other strategies
(2) Chefs:
  - You are not allowed to communicate with or train the chefs.
  - The level of a chef is directly proportional to their salary.
(3) Dishes:
  - The taste of a dish is determined by its original price. If you wish to enhance the taste, you can adjust the original price to procure better ingredients.
  - The ratio of the cost price to the selling price of a dish impacts the customer's experience.
(4) Advertisement:
  - The only available channel for advertising is the advertising module. If you wish to communicate with customers, you can only do so through this module.
