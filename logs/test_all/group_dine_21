[Olivia->all]: Hey Charlie, I've been looking at the menus for American Feast and The American Twist. Since I have a gluten allergy and prefer Mediterranean cuisine, neither option is ideal for me. However, I noticed that The American Twist offers a Classic Caesar Salad which could potentially be made gluten-free if they omit the croutons. It might not be Mediterranean, but it's a start. What do you think? Are there any dishes that stand out to you at either place?

[Charlie->all]: Hi Olivia, thanks for sharing your thoughts. I'm leaning towards American Feast because they have a Cobb Salad which I find quite appealing, and it seems like a healthier option. I also noticed they have a Classic Cheeseburger, and although I usually prefer sandwiches and salads, a burger could be a nice change. The prices at American Feast seem a bit more reasonable too. But, I'm open to considering The American Twist if they can accommodate your gluten allergy with their Classic Caesar Salad. Let's see if we can find a balance that works for both of us. What do you think about the salads at both places?

[Olivia->all]: Charlie, I'm glad you mentioned the Cobb Salad at American Feast; it does sound like a healthy option. However, with my gluten allergy, I'm a bit concerned about cross-contamination, especially with the burgers and ribs on their menu. The American Twist's Classic Caesar Salad can be easily adjusted for my dietary needs, and that's a big plus. Even though American Feast is more affordable, I think The American Twist might be a safer bet for me. Plus, their menu seems to have a more creative flair, which I always appreciate as someone with an artistic personality. How about we try The American Twist and ask if they can prepare the salad without croutons for me and maybe choose some other dishes that pique your interest? They also have Loaded Mac 'n' Cheese which sounds indulgent; perhaps that could satisfy your sandwich and salad preference this time?

[Charlie->all]: You make a good point about the potential for cross-contamination at American Feast, Olivia. Your safety and enjoyment are just as important as the meal itself. The American Twist does seem to offer more innovative dishes, and I'm definitely curious about their Twisted Burger and Smokey BBQ Ribs. Since I'm open to trying something different today, I think The American Twist could be a great choice. Their Loaded Mac 'n' Cheese sounds like a nice comfort dish as well. Let's go with The American Twist and ensure they prepare your Classic Caesar Salad without croutons. Plus, I can satisfy my salad craving with their version as well. It seems like a good compromise that caters to both our preferences and your dietary restriction. Shall we finalize this decision?

[Olivia->all]: Wow, Charlie, I must say I'm pleasantly surprised by The American Twist! My Classic Caesar Salad without croutons was fresh, and the dressing was just tangy enough without overpowering the greens. I'd give it an 8.5 for being accommodating and still delicious despite the alteration. What about you? How did you find the Twisted Burger and the Smokey BBQ Ribs?

[Charlie->all]: I'm really impressed, Olivia! The Twisted Burger was juicy and the secret sauce added a unique flavor that made it stand out. I'd rate it a solid 8. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were also a hit with their perfect balance of smokey and sweet; I'd give them an 8 as well. And let's not forget the Loaded Mac 'n' Cheese â€“ it was creamy with a nice crunch from the bacon, definitely deserving of an 8. Overall, a great dining experience at The American Twist. How did the rest of the meal stack up for you?

[Olivia->all]: I agree, Charlie. The Twisted Burger had such an intriguing taste, even though I only had a small bite of yours. I'd rate it an 8.5 as well. The Smokey BBQ Ribs, which I also tried, were deliciously tender. I would give them an 8. The Loaded Mac 'n' Cheese, I had a spoonful, and it was quite good, though not exactly my style, so I'd say a 7.5 for that. The American Twist definitely exceeded my expectations, and it was a fantastic choice for our meal. Shall we average out our scores and leave a final review?

[Olivia->all]: Hi everyone, considering our previous experience at The American Twist, I'm inclined to suggest we go there again. They've been great with accommodating my gluten-free needs, especially with the Classic Caesar Salad. Plus, their menu seems to offer a creative take on American cuisine that I think we all enjoyed last time. What do you all think? Charlie, how about you? Do you want to explore their menu further or would you like to consider American Feast and their new offerings?

[Charlie->all]: Hey Olivia, I do remember our last visit to The American Twist being quite enjoyable. I'm intrigued by the new dishes they've added, like the Garden Veggie Burger and the Southwest Quinoa Salad, which could be a fresh experience for us. However, I'm also tempted by American Feast's advertisement for the 'American Surprise' and the revamped Cobb Salad. It might be interesting to compare their take on the BBQ Ribs and Classic Cheeseburger to what we had at The American Twist. I'm a bit torn, to be honest. Let's hear what the others have to say before we make a decision.

[Olivia->all]: I see your point, Charlie. It's always exciting to try new things, and American Feast's 'American Surprise' does sound tempting. But I do have a soft spot for The American Twist, given their attentive service and the way they cater to my dietary restrictions without any fuss. Plus, their new Garden Veggie Burger might just be the artistic flair I'm looking for in a dish. What about the rest of you? Do you have any preferences or dietary concerns we should consider before we decide?

[Charlie->all]: Well, I must admit, both options have their allure. The American Twist certainly left a good impression last time, and the idea of revisiting it for the new dishes like the Southwest Quinoa Salad, which aligns with my preference for salads, is appealing. Yet, the notion of variety and the mystery behind the 'American Surprise' at American Feast piques my curiosity. Given that we don't have dietary restrictions to worry about, I suggest we take a chance on American Feast this time. It could provide us with a new set of flavors to discuss and enjoy. Plus, their Cobb Salad could be a worthy contender against our last salad experience. What do you say, shall we venture into the unknown or stick with the familiar comfort of The American Twist?

[Olivia->all]: Wow, I have to say the Cobb Salad was a delightful surprise, very fresh and the dressing was spot on. I'd give it an 8.2. The Classic Cheeseburger was also quite tasty, maybe not as unique as the Twisted Burger we had last time, but still very satisfying, so I'll rate it an 8.1. The BBQ Ribs, however, were the star of the show for me, tender and flavorful, deserving a solid 8.5. What do you all think?

[Charlie->all]: The Cobb Salad definitely exceeded my expectations with its fresh ingredients and perfect dressing, so I'd agree with an 8.2. The Classic Cheeseburger was good, but I did miss the uniqueness of the Twisted Burger; I'll give it an 8.0. However, the BBQ Ribs were indeed excellent, and I think they deserve an 8.5 as well. It seems American Feast has lived up to our adventurous decision! What are your thoughts on how it compares to our experience at The American Twist?

[Olivia->all]: I must say, I'm quite impressed with American Feast. The Cobb Salad was refreshing and well-balanced, a definite 8.2 for me. The Classic Cheeseburger, while delicious, didn't quite have that special something we found in The American Twist's Twisted Burger, but it still gets a solid 8.1 from me. The BBQ Ribs were absolutely delightful, tender, and packed with flavor, so I'd give them an 8.5. I think American Feast offered us a lovely variety and a satisfying meal overall. How does everyone else feel about the dishes and the overall experience compared to The American Twist?

[Charlie->all]: I'm inclined to agree with the ratings given. The Cobb Salad was refreshing, and I'd also rate it an 8.2. The Classic Cheeseburger was hearty and fulfilling, deserving an 8.0 from me. The BBQ Ribs, on the other hand, were exceptional - the flavors were well-balanced, and the meat was perfectly tender. I'd rate them an 8.5. Comparing to The American Twist, American Feast certainly held its own with the quality of dishes. The 'American Surprise' was indeed a pleasant addition to our meal.

[Olivia->all]: I must say, The Twisted Burger truly lived up to its reputation, the new sauce was a fantastic addition. I'd give it a score of 9. The Southwest Quinoa Salad was refreshing and the chipotle-lime dressing gave it just the right kick, so I think an 8.5 would be fair. The Garden Veggie Burger was delicious and satisfying, especially considering my gluten-free needs, I'll rate it an 8.5. Lastly, The American Dream dessert was the perfect sweet ending to our meal, deserving an 8.5. What are your thoughts, Charlie?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I completely agree with your assessment. The Twisted Burger was exceptional, and the new sauce added an exciting twist, so that's a 9 for me as well. The Southwest Quinoa Salad was quite a delight with its bold dressing, so I'm happy to give it an 8.5. The Garden Veggie Burger was really up to the mark, a solid 8.5 in my book. And The American Dream dessert? A beautifully balanced treat, also deserving an 8.5. I think our scores are quite aligned. Shall we move on to the final review?
