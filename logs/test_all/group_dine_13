[Wade->all]: Well, considering our family's situation, I think American Feast might be the more sensible choice for us. The prices are a bit more affordable, and the menu options seem like simple, hearty meals that we would enjoy. The Classic Cheeseburger and Cobb Salad seem like good options that are within our budget. What do you think, Ivy and Emma?

[Ivy->all]: I agree that American Feast fits our budget better, and I can see that they have a Classic Cheeseburger which sounds delicious. However, I do have a craving for seafood, and neither menu seems to offer that. But since we're considering our budget and the preferences of the whole family, I think American Feast's BBQ Ribs could be a nice change. Plus, the Apple Pie a la Mode sounds like a lovely treat for Emma. Let's see what she thinks before we make a final decision. Emma, honey, what catches your eye on these menus?

[Emma->all]: I'm leaning towards American Feast as well. It's important to me that we pick a place that's affordable, and their prices seem more reasonable for us. Also, I love the idea of having something fresh like the Cobb Salad since I prefer organic food when possible. The Apple Pie a la Mode does sound like a sweet end to the meal. I think American Feast is a good choice for us, keeping in mind our budget and my preference for more natural food options. Plus, I think Dad and Mom will enjoy the Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs. Shall we decide on American Feast, then?

[Wade->all]: I must say, the Classic Cheeseburger was a solid choice. It was juicy and the cheddar cheese was just the right amount of meltiness. I'm quite satisfied with it. I'd give it an 8. The BBQ Ribs were also very tasty; the meat was tender and the sauce had a good balance of sweetness and tanginess. I think that deserves an 8 as well. The Apple Pie a la Mode was a delightful finish to the meal, warm and comforting. Another 8 from me. Overall, I'm happy with our choice. What do you think, Ivy?

[Ivy->all]: I'm glad we went with American Feast. The BBQ Ribs were a highlight for me, the sauce was flavorful without being overpowering, and the ribs were cooked just right. I'd give them an 8. The Cobb Salad was fresh and the ingredients tasted like they were of good quality, so I'd also rate that an 8. The Apple Pie a la Mode was delicious, with the warm pie and cold ice cream making a great combination - that's an 8 for me as well. Emma, your thoughts?

[Emma->all]: I'm really pleased with our meal at American Feast. The Cobb Salad was fresh and the mixture of flavors from the avocado, bacon, and blue cheese made it quite enjoyable, I would rate it an 8. The Apple Pie a la Mode was just the right amount of sweetness for me, and the vanilla ice cream was a perfect match to the warm pie, so I give that an 8 too. I also tried a bit of the Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs that mom and dad ordered, and I think they both deserve an 8. They were flavorful and well-prepared. It seems like we all enjoyed our meal. Shall we give our final scores?

[Ivy->all]: I'm torn between the two restaurants. American Feast's BBQ Ribs were really good last time, and I see they're advertising an 'American Surprise' which could be interesting. But, The American Twist also has Smokey BBQ Ribs, and they might be worth trying since they're described as even more tender. They also have a Southwest Quinoa Salad, which might be a nice seafood alternative for me. What do you both think?

[Emma->all]: I noticed that The American Twist has a Garden Veggie Burger, which aligns with my preference for organic and healthier options. Plus, their Southwest Quinoa Salad could be a good choice for us all, as it seems fresh and flavorful. However, I also see that American Feast has introduced a revamped Cobb Salad, which I really enjoyed last time. It's a tough decision, but I'm leaning a bit towards The American Twist because of their unique offerings and the high customer score. Dad, what's your take on this?

[Wade->all]: Well, I appreciate the simplicity and heartiness of the meals at American Feast, especially that Classic Cheeseburger. However, I'm also curious about the Twisted Burger from The American Twist. It sounds like it could be a nice change, and I'm all for trying something new as long as it's within our budget. The American Twist also seems to have a slightly higher customer score, which is promising. Given our last experience was good with American Feast, I'm inclined to try The American Twist this time to compare the difference. Maybe we can find a new favorite. Ivy, Emma, shall we give The American Twist a try and order the Twisted Burger, Smokey BBQ Ribs, Garden Veggie Burger, and Southwest Quinoa Salad?

[Wade->all]: The Twisted Burger was a pleasant surprise; the secret sauce added an unexpected but delightful flavor. I'd rate it a solid 9. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were also quite good, but a tad below the ones at American Feast, so I'll give them an 8. The Garden Veggie Burger was impressive for a vegetarian option, and I'd also rate it an 8. As for the Southwest Quinoa Salad, it was refreshing and had a nice mix of flavors, deserving an 8 as well. Overall, I'm pleased with our meal here at The American Twist. Ivy, what are your thoughts?

[Ivy->all]: I must say, The American Twist didn't disappoint. The Twisted Burger was exceptional, with its unique sauce really standing out for me; I'd give it a 9. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were good, but not as memorable as the ones at American Feast, so it's an 8 from me. The Garden Veggie Burger was surprisingly satisfying, even for a non-vegetarian like me, so that's an 8. The Southwest Quinoa Salad was a great seafood alternative, very fresh, so I'll give that an 8 too. Emma, your turn to weigh in. What did you think?

[Emma->all]: I really enjoyed the Garden Veggie Burger, it was full of flavor and the patty had a great texture, definitely a 9 for me. The Twisted Burger had a really interesting sauce that I liked a lot, so I'm giving it an 8. The Southwest Quinoa Salad was quite refreshing and the lime vinaigrette was a perfect dressing for it, so it gets an 8 from me as well. As for the Smokey BBQ Ribs, they were nice but I preferred the ones at American Feast, so I'll rate them a 7. All in all, a great dining experience at The American Twist!

The Smokey BBQ Ribs were good but didn't quite live up to our previous experience with the ribs at American Feast, hence the slightly lower score. The Garden Veggie Burger was a pleasant surprise, offering a delicious vegetarian option that we all enjoyed. The Southwest Quinoa Salad provided a refreshing and flavorful alternative to our usual choices. In summary, while we enjoyed American Feast on our last visit, The American Twist offered a new and satisfying experience with its own standout dishes, and we would be happy to come back again."

[Ivy->all]: Okay family, let's think about where to eat next. I noticed American Feast has a Quinoa & Spinach Salad that could be a nice, light option for us, and their BBQ Ribs have been a hit in the past. The American Surprise also intrigues me. But The American Twist is advertising an improved Classic Caesar Salad and that new dessert, The American Dream, which sounds tempting. The Garden Veggie Burger and Southwest Quinoa Salad are still there, which we liked. What do you both think, considering taste, health, and our budget?

[Emma->all]: I'm still quite fond of The American Twist because of their focus on healthier options, like the Garden Veggie Burger and the Southwest Quinoa Salad, which were both delicious last time. The Classic Caesar Salad might be a good addition to try since they've improved it, and The American Dream dessert sounds like a delightful treat. It seems like The American Twist has a good variety of options that cater to our needs, and their customer score is quite high. However, American Feast's Quinoa & Spinach Salad and the BBQ Ribs are also tempting, especially since we know the ribs are good. It's a tough choice, but my vote is slightly leaning towards The American Twist for their unique offerings and because we had a great experience there last time. Dad, what do you think?

[Wade->all]: Both restaurants have their appeal for sure. American Feast's BBQ Ribs have been consistently good and that American Surprise could be quite the treat. Plus, their Quinoa & Spinach Salad could be a healthier option for us. On the other hand, The American Twist has that Twisted Burger which was a hit, and their Garden Veggie Burger and Southwest Quinoa Salad were both satisfying and fit our budget well. The Classic Caesar Salad, being improved, might be worth a try, and The American Dream dessert does sound like a nice end to a meal. Considering our last experience at The American Twist was positive, and their customer score is higher, I'm inclined to agree with Emma. The healthier options are definitely a plus for us, and it would be nice to see if they've maintained the quality we enjoyed last time. Ivy, Emma, if you're both in agreement, I think we should give The American Twist another visit and see how the improved dishes fare. Shall we go for that?

We decided to order the Twisted Burger and Garden Veggie Burger again, along with the Southwest Quinoa Salad.

[Ivy->all]: Well family, I see both American Feast and The American Twist are offering some interesting options. American Feast has that Healthier BBQ Ribs which might be a good balance for us between flavor and health, and their Quinoa & Spinach Salad seems like it could be a light and refreshing choice. Their American Indulgence dessert could be a nice treat without going overboard. On the other hand, The American Twist has that Twisted Burger we all liked, and the Garden Veggie Burger and Southwest Quinoa Salad were hits last time. Plus, they have the Classic Caesar Salad which they've improved. What are your thoughts on these choices considering our health, taste for seafood, and budget? 

[Emma]: I like the sound of the Healthier BBQ Ribs from American Feast, and the Quinoa & Spinach Salad aligns with our healthy eating goals. The American Indulgence dessert also sounds like it's worth a try. However, I do have a soft spot for The American Twist's Garden Veggie Burger and Southwest Quinoa Salad. The improved Classic Caesar Salad is tempting, and I wouldn't mind trying the Twisted Burger again. It's a tough call, but I think I'm leaning towards The American Twist for the consistency in healthy choices and because I remember the service being quite good last time.

[Wade]: I'm intrigued by the new dishes at American Feast, especially the Healthier BBQ Ribs and the Superfood Power Bowl. It's nice to see they're offering more health-conscious options. The American Indulgence dessert sounds like a good balance of health and indulgence. Yet, I must admit The American Twist has a proven track record with us. The Twisted Burger was very satisfying, and if the Classic Caesar Salad has indeed improved, it could be a nice addition to our meal. Plus, the high customer score is reassuring. I think my vote goes to The American Twist for maintaining quality and providing healthy options we've enjoyed before. 

[Ivy]: It seems we're all somewhat torn, but I'm hearing a slight preference for The American Twist. They've been reliable in the past, and it's important that we enjoy our meal without breaking the bank or compromising on health. The improved Classic Caesar Salad sounds like a good way to see if they've kept up their standards. Okay, let's discuss a bit more and make a decision.

[Emma->all]: After hearing everyone's thoughts, I think we're leaning towards The American Twist. Their menu has the healthy options we loved before, and they've made improvements to other dishes like the Classic Caesar Salad. Even though American Feast has some tempting new dishes, it feels like a safer bet to go with The American Twist since we had a great experience there previously. Plus, the high customer score does give me more confidence in our choice. If we're all in agreement, I think we should finalize our decision and enjoy another meal at The American Twist. Shall we go ahead and place our order?

[Wade->all]: I think we've all made some great points about both restaurants. American Feast's Healthier BBQ Ribs and Superfood Power Bowl certainly caught my attention for being hearty yet health-conscious. However, The American Twist does seem to have a slight edge for us, especially with the familiar dishes that we've enjoyed in the past. Their improved Classic Caesar Salad and the consistently good Twisted Burger and Garden Veggie Burger are tempting. Considering our past positive experience and their high customer score, my vote is still with The American Twist. But I want to make sure we're all on the same page before we make a final decision. What do you both think?

We decided to order the Twisted Burger and Garden Veggie Burger again, along with the Southwest Quinoa Salad.

[Ivy->all]: Alright family, it's time to decide where we're going to eat tonight. We've got American Feast and The American Twist as our options. American Feast is tempting with that new 'The American Adventure' dish that changes weekly, and I do like the idea of their 'The Smokey Mountain Burger'. They're also advertising a health-conscious dessert, 'The Sweet Freedom Dessert', which could be a nice finish to our meal. But I must say, The American Twist also has some appealing offerings with their improved Southwest Quinoa Salad and that mysterious American Secret dish. Plus, their customer score is slightly higher. What do you all think?

[Emma]: I'm drawn to American Feast's focus on healthier options, like the 'Healthier BBQ Ribs' and 'The Superfood Power Bowl'. It sounds like they've got a good balance of tasty and healthy. And 'The American Surprise' dish sounds fun. But I do remember enjoying the food at The American Twist, and they have that 'American Dream' dessert that sounds divine. It's a tough choice!

[Wade]: I'm intrigued by the 'The American Adventure' dish at American Feast, the idea of trying different regional flavors is interesting. But The American Twist has that high customer score for a reason. Their Twisted Burger was a hit with us last time, and if they've managed to improve upon their Classic Caesar Salad, that could be great. Plus, consistency is key, and we know what to expect from them. 

[Ivy]: Let's do another round of thoughts and see if we can come to a decision. Emma, what's your final take?

[Emma]: Well, considering everything, I think I'm leaning towards The American Twist. Their consistency and the customer score are reassuring, and I do have fond memories of their dishes. Plus, they seem to have a good balance of healthy and indulgent options.

[Wade]: I have to agree with Emma on this one. The American Twist has proven their quality to us before, and I'm curious about the improved dishes. It seems like a safe bet for a satisfying meal. 

[Ivy]: Alright, it seems we have a consensus. The American Twist it is. Let's order some of our favorites and give those improved dishes a try. I'm excited to see if the Classic Caesar Salad has indeed gotten better.

We considered the healthier options at American Feast, but ultimately, the consistent quality and higher customer score of The American Twist swayed our decision. We've enjoyed their food in the past, and the improved dishes on their menu, such as the Classic Caesar Salad, have piqued our interest. We're ordering a couple of our favorite burgers, the Twisted Burger and the Garden Veggie Burger, along with the Southwest Quinoa Salad and the improved Classic Caesar Salad. To top it off, we'll indulge in 'The American Dream' dessert. We're looking forward to another satisfying meal at The American Twist."
}

[Emma->all]: So, I've been thinking about our options, and I really appreciate American Feast's innovative approach to healthier dishes. The 'Healthier BBQ Ribs' and 'The Superfood Power Bowl' really stand out to me. But on the other hand, The American Twist has that comforting familiarity, and they've made efforts to improve their menu too. Their 'Southwest Quinoa Salad' with the new dressing could be a refreshing choice. I remember how much we enjoyed their 'Garden Veggie Burger' last time. It's a hard choice, but I think the balance of healthy and indulgent options at The American Twist might just tip the scales for me. What do you both think?

[Ivy]: I'm leaning towards The American Twist as well. I like the idea of the improved dishes, and that 'American Dream' dessert is calling my name. Plus, their customer score is impressive. It's comforting to know we're likely to have a good experience there based on that.

[Wade]: I'm still quite tempted by American Feast's 'The American Adventure' dish, but I can't deny that The American Twist has been reliable for us. The fact that they're constantly improving is a good sign. I'm all for giving The American Twist another try, especially to see how they've upped their game with the Classic Caesar Salad.

[Emma]: Great, so it seems we've made our decision. Let's go with The American Twist and order some of the dishes we know we love, and try those improved ones as well. Shall I summarize our order?

[Wade]: Go ahead, Emma.

[Wade->all]: I've been mulling over our choices between American Feast and The American Twist. The 'Healthier BBQ Ribs' and 'The Superfood Power Bowl' from American Feast do sound appealing for a healthier meal that's still packed with flavor. But I must admit, the high customer score and our past enjoyable experiences at The American Twist are hard to overlook. Their 'Twisted Burger' and 'Garden Veggie Burger' were hits with us before, and I'm intrigued by their improved 'Southwest Quinoa Salad' and 'Classic Caesar Salad'. Quality and consistency are important, especially when our budget doesn't allow for many outings like this. What are your thoughts, Ivy and Emma?

[Ivy]: I'm attracted to the idea of 'The American Adventure' dish at American Feast, as it's a unique concept and I'm all for trying new flavors. However, The American Twist's 'American Dream' dessert does sound like a lovely way to end our meal. It's tough, but I think I'm leaning more towards The American Twist, especially considering their slightly higher customer score and our previous positive experiences there.

[Emma]: I'm torn because I do like the healthier options at American Feast, but I also remember how much we enjoyed our meal at The American Twist. It might be nice to go back to somewhere familiar where we know we'll enjoy the food. Plus, the idea of trying their improved dishes is quite appealing.

[Wade]: It seems we're all leaning towards The American Twist, perhaps for the familiarity and the confidence we have in their food. Let's do another round of thoughts to make sure we're all in agreement. Ivy, any more thoughts?

[Ivy]: After thinking it over, I'm definitely in favor of The American Twist. The consistency and the idea of improved dishes give me confidence that we'll have a pleasant dining experience.

[Wade->all]: That Twisted Burger was just as good as I remember, maybe even better with that secret sauce. I'd give it a solid 9 out of 10. The Garden Veggie Burger was also delicious, very flavorful for a veggie option, so I'm giving it a 9 as well. The Southwest Quinoa Salad was fresh and the new dressing really added to it, I'll rate that an 8. The Classic Caesar Salad was indeed improved, a good 8 for me. And The American Dream dessert, wow, it was the perfect end to our meal, definitely a 9.

[Ivy]: I agree, the Twisted Burger was exceptional, a 9 from me too. The Garden Veggie Burger was surprisingly satisfying for a meatless option, also a 9. The Southwest Quinoa Salad with that chipotle-lime dressing was a nice touch, an 8 for sure. The Classic Caesar Salad was better than before, so an 8 from me. The American Dream dessert was delicious, not too sweet, just perfect, a 9.

[Emma]: The Twisted Burger definitely deserves a 9; it was delicious. The Garden Veggie Burger was a pleasant surprise, I'll give it a 9 as well. That Southwest Quinoa Salad was refreshing, especially with the new dressing, so I'm rating it an 8. The Classic Caesar Salad was good, much improved, so an 8. And The American Dream dessert was dreamy indeed, a 9 for that one.

[Emma->all]: Both American Feast and The American Twist have really appealing options. I like that American Feast has a variety of healthy dishes like the 'Healthier BBQ Ribs' and 'The Superfood Power Bowl'. It's great to see they focus on health without compromising on flavor. The 'The American Adventure' dish changing weekly is a nice touch too. But The American Twist seems to offer a balance with their 'Garden Veggie Burger' and the 'Southwest Quinoa Salad' which we've enjoyed in the past. Plus, they have a slightly higher customer score. It's a tough decision!

[Ivy]: I'm drawn to American Feast's commitment to health-conscious dishes. The 'Quinoa & Spinach Salad' and 'The Sweet Freedom Dessert' sound like they would be delicious without being too indulgent. However, I do remember the quality of the food at The American Twist, and their 'American Dream' dessert sounds tempting. 

[Wade]: I think both restaurants have their merits. American Feast's 'Healthier BBQ Ribs' seem like a healthier twist on a classic favorite, which is appealing. On the other hand, The American Twist has that 'Twisted Burger' with the improved secret sauce, and I'm curious to see how it's changed. Plus, their consistency is a big plus for me. 

[Emma]: I think we should consider which restaurant has a better selection of dishes that cater to our preference for organic food. Also, the service quality indicated by the customer score could be a deciding factor. Shall we go another round to see if we can reach a consensus?

[Ivy]: Yes, let's discuss a bit more. I'm leaning slightly towards American Feast for their healthy options, but I agree that we should consider the overall quality and service, as indicated by the customer score. The American Twist does seem to have a slight edge there.

[Wade]: I agree with both of you. We should weigh our options with a focus on the quality and healthiness of the food. Let's take another round of discussion to finalize our decision. 

[Emma]: After giving it some more thought, I'm feeling more inclined towards The American Twist. We've had good experiences there, and their menu still offers some healthy options alongside the more indulgent ones. Plus, their customer score is slightly higher.

[Ivy]: I think you make a good point, Emma. The American Twist does offer a balance, and their higher customer score is reassuring. I'm fine with giving The American Twist another try, especially to see how they've improved their familiar dishes.

[Wade]: I'm convinced by your points. The balance between healthy and indulgent at The American Twist, along with their track record with us, makes it a solid choice. Let's go with The American Twist. Emma, can you summarize our final decision?

[Emma]: Certainly, Dad. Here's our summary:

{
    "restaurant": "The American Twist",
    "dishes": [
        "Twisted Burger", "Garden Veggie Burger", "Southwest Quinoa Salad", "Classic Caesar Salad", "The American Dream"

We're also excited to try their improved dishes such as the 'Twisted Burger' with the new secret sauce. Ending the meal with 'The American Dream' dessert seems like a delightful choice. Our decision was influenced by the overall quality of food and service that we've come to expect from The American Twist."
}

[Wade->all]: I've been giving it some thought, and I must say, American Feast's focus on health-conscious dishes like the 'Healthier BBQ Ribs' and 'The Superfood Power Bowl' is appealing to me, especially considering we try to eat healthy on a budget. The idea of their 'The American Adventure' dish that changes weekly is also intriguing. It could be a nice surprise for us.

[Emma]: I agree with you, Dad. It's great to see a restaurant offering healthier options. I'm also drawn to the 'Quinoa & Spinach Salad' and 'The Sweet Freedom Dessert' at American Feast. It sounds like we could have a delicious meal without feeling guilty afterward. Plus, it's always nice to try something new with their weekly special.

[Ivy]: I'm a bit torn. While American Feast's healthy options are certainly attractive, I can't help but remember how much we enjoyed the food at The American Twist. Their 'Twisted Burger' and 'Garden Veggie Burger' were really good, and they have a higher customer score, which might indicate better service.

[Wade]: It's a tough choice. Both places offer dishes that cater to our simple tastes and health-conscious lifestyle. How about we discuss it a bit more? Maybe we can come to a decision that satisfies all our criteria.

[Emma]: Sure, Dad. I think it's also important to consider the overall dining experience, not just the health aspect. The American Twist does have that slightly higher customer score, which could mean better service. Plus, familiarity can be comforting.

[Ivy]: That's true, Emma. Although I'm inclined towards the healthy options at American Feast, I think the overall experience is also important. If The American Twist has improved their dishes, it might be worth trying out.

[Wade]: I appreciate both your points. Quality and service are indeed important, and if The American Twist has made improvements, it could be a great experience. Let's go for The American Twist, considering their higher customer score and our past experiences. Emma, could you summarize our final decision?

}

[Ivy->all]: I'm leaning towards The American Twist. The 'Twisted Burger' and 'Garden Veggie Burger' were hits for us last time, and it seems like they've made some improvements to their menu that could be interesting to try. Plus, their customer score is a bit higher, which might indicate that their service is a tad better. 

What do you both think? Should we give The American Twist another shot or try something new with American Feast's healthier options? Let's discuss this further and make a decision.

[Emma->all]: I'm inclined to agree with you, Mom. The American Twist has been a good experience for us in the past, and their focus on improving classic dishes is appealing. The higher customer score does suggest that we might have a better service experience there too. Their menu also seems to have a good balance of healthy options, which is important for us. 

[Wade]: Well, I do like the sound of American Feast's healthy dishes, but I can't deny that we've always had a good time at The American Twist. The customer score difference isn't huge, but it might be indicative of the overall experience we can expect.

[Ivy]: That's true, Wade. I think we're all leaning towards The American Twist now. Their menu does offer some healthy options, and we know they're good at what they do. Plus, it's always nice to go back to a place where we've had a good experience before. 

[Emma]: Agreed, let's finalize on The American Twist then. I'll go ahead and summarize our decision:

}

[Wade->all]: Ivy, Emma, we have to decide where to eat tonight. Remember, we need to keep our meal simple and within our budget. What are your thoughts on American Feast and The American Twist?

[Ivy]: I like that American Feast has a variety of healthy dishes. The 'Healthier BBQ Ribs' and 'The Superfood Power Bowl' sound like they're flavorful without being too heavy. Plus, the 'The American Adventure' dish changes weekly, which might be a fun surprise.

[Emma]: I'm drawn to American Feast's 'Quinoa & Spinach Salad' and 'The Sweet Freedom Dessert' because they seem light and not overly sweet. But, The American Twist has that 'Twisted Burger' we all liked before, and their 'Southwest Quinoa Salad' is something we've enjoyed in the past. They also have a slightly higher customer score.

[Wade]: It's a tough choice. American Feast seems to offer a healthier menu, which is good for us, but The American Twist has been consistently good every time we've gone there. Let's discuss more to make sure we're making the best choice for our family.

[Ivy]: I'm leaning more towards American Feast for their healthier options. However, The American Twist has that higher customer score, which might mean better service. We should also consider our past experiences there.

[Emma]: That's true. The American Twist has always been reliable. We should think about which restaurant offers the best combination of healthy options and overall satisfaction.

[Wade]: After considering both options, I think The American Twist might be the right choice for us. They offer a mix of healthy and indulgent dishes, and we know from experience that we like their food and service.

[Ivy]: I agree, Wade. The American Twist seems to provide a good balance, and we've always left happy. I think it's worth going back to see how they've improved their dishes.

[Emma]: I'm convinced as well. Let's go with The American Twist. They have healthy options like the 'Southwest Quinoa Salad' and the 'Garden Veggie Burger' that we liked before. Plus, their dessert, 'The American Dream', sounds like a nice treat.

[Ivy->all]: Alright, let's discuss where we should eat tonight. I've always had a soft spot for seafood, and I know The American Twist has that 'Weekly Wonder' which might include a seafood dish. Their 'Twisted Burger' has always been a hit with us, and it seems they've improved it even further. What do you two think?

[Wade]: I do like The American Twist, especially because they host those community events which always have a great vibe. However, American Feast has that 'New England Clam Chowder' on the menu, and I know how much you love seafood, Ivy. Plus, their 'Healthier BBQ Ribs' and 'Superfood Power Bowl' sound like they've got some great, healthy options for us.

[Emma]: I'm torn because I love the 'Twisted Burger', but American Feast's 'Mystery Twist Dish' sounds exciting and I'm curious about it. Also, their emphasis on healthful dishes is appealing to me. Maybe we should try something new and go for American Feast this time?
