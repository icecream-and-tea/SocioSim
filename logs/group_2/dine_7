    "restaurant": "Stars & Stripes USA",
    "score": 8,
    "comment": "Stars & Stripes USA delivered on flavor with their BBQ Ribs and Cheesecake, though the ribs could have been a touch more tender. The cheesecake was a standout, perfectly balancing richness and berry freshness. Overall, a satisfying meal with room for improvement in meat tenderness."
