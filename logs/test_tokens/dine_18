    "restaurant": "Le Petit Gourmet",
    "score": 6,
    "comment": "The dishes at Le Petit Gourmet were decent but not exceptional. The Coq au Vin had a good flavor, but the chicken could have been a bit more tender. The Ratatouille was tasty but lacked a bit of seasoning. The Tarte Tatin was a nice finish to the meal but was not as caramelized as I would have liked. The wine, Chateauneuf du Pape, was a highlight though. It paired well with the dishes and added to the overall dining experience. Compared to other restaurants I've been to, Le Petit Gourmet needs to improve on its seasoning and cooking techniques to make the dishes more flavorful and appealing."
