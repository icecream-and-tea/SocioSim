        "Coq au Vin", "Bouillabaisse"
    ],
    "reason" : "Le Petit Gourmet offers a broader menu with more variety, including several stew-like dishes that appeal to my personal taste. The Coq au Vin and Bouillabaisse both sound delicious and align with my preference for soups and stews. Moreover, as a diabetic, these dishes seem to be lower in sugar content compared to the desserts offered. While the prices at Le Petit Gourmet are slightly lower than Le Petit Bistro, which is more suitable for my middle-class income."

    "comment": "The overall experience at Le Petit Gourmet was quite enjoyable. The Coq au Vin and Bouillabaisse were tasty and comforting, just as I expected. They were well-prepared and flavorful, although not the best I've ever had. The restaurant atmosphere was pleasant and the service was decent. However, I do believe there is room for improvement. The dishes could have been warmer upon serving and the waiting time was slightly longer than I anticipated. On the bright side, these meals fit well with my dietary needs, being low in sugar and satisfying my preference for soups and stews. I would recommend Le Petit Gourmet to others, especially those who enjoy French cuisine and have similar dietary restrictions."
