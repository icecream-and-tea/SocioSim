[Hugo->Hugo]: {
    "restaurant": "Le Petit Gourmet",
    "score": 6,
    "comment": "The Coq au Vin at Le Petit Gourmet was decent, but not exceptional. It had a good flavor, but I've had better elsewhere. The Ratatouille was a bit underwhelming, it lacked the depth of flavor I was expecting. The Tarte Tatin was okay, but the apples could have been more caramelized. Overall, the dining experience was satisfactory but could definitely use some improvements. The service was good and the ambiance was pleasant. However, I believe that the restaurant would benefit from adding more gourmet options to the menu, particularly in terms of their main dishes."
