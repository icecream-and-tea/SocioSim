    "comment": "The dishes at Le Petit Gourmet were decent. The Coq au Vin and Bouillabaisse were flavorful, although I found the Tarte Tatin a bit too sweet for my taste. The service was satisfactory. I think the restaurant could use some improvements, especially in terms of dessert options. I will consider trying other restaurants next time to better compare the quality of food and service."
