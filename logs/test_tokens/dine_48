    "comment": "I found the dishes at Le Petit Gourmet to be quite enjoyable, even though they were not of my preferred Caribbean cuisine. The Coq au Vin and Bouillabaisse were particularly tasty, with rich and hearty flavors. However, the Ratatouille and Tarte Tatin could use some improvement. The Ratatouille was a little bland, and the Tarte Tatin was not as sweet as I would have liked. Moreover, while the service was satisfactory, I think it could be a little more attentive and engaging. In comparison to other restaurants I've been to, Le Petit Gourmet offers a decent experience but there's definitely room for improvement. "
