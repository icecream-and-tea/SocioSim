[Oscar->Oscar]: {
    "restaurant": "Le Petit Gourmet",
    "score": 6,
    "comment": "The dining experience at Le Petit Gourmet was decent but not outstanding. The Coq au Vin was well cooked and flavorful, however, the Ratatouille was slightly overcooked and lacked some seasoning. The Tarte Tatin was okay, but it was not as caramelized as I would have liked. The Chateauneuf du Pape was a good pairing for the meal, but it was not extraordinary. The service was fair but could be improved in terms of speed and attentiveness. Overall, the experience was alright, but I believe there is room for improvement in both food quality and service."
