    "comment": "The Ratatouille was quite good with a balance of flavors, however, the Tarte Tatin was a bit too sweet for my liking, considering my dietary restriction. I appreciate the variety in the menu, but I would suggest the restaurant to consider offering more dishes catering to people with dietary restrictions like myself."
