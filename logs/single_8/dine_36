   [{'day': 14, 'name': 'Wade', 'score': 8, 'content': 'The Hickory-Smoked BBQ Ribs had a robust smoky essence, yet a touch more tenderness would make them outstanding. The Heritage Apple Pie Deluxe offered a slice of homestyle comfort. The dishes are good, though not exceptional. A slight enhancement in texture and boldness could elevate these familiar favorites.'}, {'day': 14, 'name': 'Eve', 'score': 7, 'content': "The flavors of the Hickory-Smoked BBQ Ribs and Heritage Apple Pie Deluxe were familiar and comforting, yet they lacked the refinement I hoped for. The ribs could benefit from being more tender, and the pie's crust desired a flakier texture. While enjoyable, there's room for improvement to make the dishes stand out."}, {'day': 13, 'name': 'Eve', 'score': 7, 'content': "While the Hickory-Smoked BBQ Ribs and Heritage Apple Pie Deluxe were good, they lacked a certain flair. The ribs needed to be more tender, and the pie's crust could be flakier. I found my meal satisfying, but for future visits, a slight improvement in these areas would enhance the experience."}, {'day': 12, 'name': 'Vicky', 'score': 7, 'content': 'The Hickory-Smoked BBQ Ribs had a lovely smoky flavor but could be more tender. The Heritage Apple Pie Deluxe was comforting, yet the bourbon whipped cream lacked the boldness I anticipated. Good comfort food, yet I miss the innovation that could make the dishes stand out more.'}, {'day': 12, 'name': 'Eve', 'score': 8, 'content': 'The Hickory-Smoked BBQ Ribs had a lovely smoky flavor, but I would have preferred them to be a little more tender. The Heritage Apple Pie Deluxe was comforting with a nicely spiced filling, though the bourbon-infused whipped cream could have been more pronounced. Overall, a solid meal that satisfies my preference for simple, hearty dishes.'}]
