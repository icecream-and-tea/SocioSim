The Coq au Vin, traditionally a rich and hearty dish, was slightly underwhelming in taste. The Ratatouille was decent with fresh vegetables, but it could use more seasoning. The Tarte Tatin was enjoyable with a nice balance of sweet and tart flavors. The French Onion Soup and Cheese Plate were satisfactory but not remarkable. I appreciate their use of locally sourced ingredients, but I believe the execution and flavor profiles could be improved. I have dined at other restaurants where the dishes were more flavorful and memorable."

    "comment": "The dishes at Le Petit Gourmet were quite satisfactory, but didn't quite live up to my expectations. The Coq au Vin and Beef Bourguignon, while flavorful, lacked a certain depth to their sauces. The Ratatouille was fresh and colorful, but could use a bit more seasoning, and the Tarte Tatin was a delightful end to the meal. The French Onion Soup was a highlight with its rich and hearty flavor. The service was efficient and polite but lacked warmth. I appreciate the affordable prices and the variety in the menu, but there's room for improvement in terms of the overall taste and dining experience."
