    "comment": "I was initially attracted to Le Petit Gourmet due to their menu variety and reasonable prices. However, the dishes I tried - the Croque Monsieur and Salade Niçoise - were just average in taste. The sandwich lacked the depth of flavor I was expecting, and the salad, while fresh, didn't have any standout ingredients. I appreciated the service and the ambiance of the restaurant, but the food did not meet my expectations. In future, I might consider trying other items on their menu or perhaps give La Petite Maison a chance."

The salad was too bland and the sandwich, although well-grilled, lacked a depth of flavor. In terms of service, it was decent but not exceptional. The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and welcoming. However, I believe there's room for improvement in their culinary skills and service quality. I hope they take this feedback into account and improve for a better dining experience."
