The sandwich lacked the depth of flavor I was expecting, and the salad, while fresh, didn't have any standout ingredients. I appreciated the service and the ambiance of the restaurant, but the food did not meet my expectations. In future, I might consider trying other items on their menu or perhaps give La Petite Maison a chance."

[Charlie->Charlie]: {
    "restaurant": "Le Petit Gourmet",
    "score": 6,
    "comment": "The meal at Le Petit Gourmet was decent but there is room for improvement. The Ratatouille was flavorful, but it lacked some freshness I expected from the vegetables. The Crème Brûlée was also satisfactory but the sugar topping was not caramelized enough to create the desired crisp texture. The restaurant's atmosphere was indeed warm and cozy as advertised, but the service could be more prompt. Comparing with my past dining experiences, I'd say the quality of the food and service at Le Petit Gourmet is slightly above average."
