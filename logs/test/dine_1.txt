The Ratatouille could have used a bit more seasoning to bring out the flavors of the vegetables, and the Tarte Tatin was a bit too sweet for my taste. The service was decent, but improvements could be made in terms of speed and attentiveness. I have dined at other restaurants with similar cuisine and found their dishes to be more flavorful and their service to be more efficient. I would recommend Le Petit Gourmet to expand their vegetarian options and focus on improving the balance of flavors in their dishes."

    "comment": "The Ratatouille at Lin's Maison Gourmet was decent but did not meet my expectations. The vegetables were slightly overcooked and the seasoning was not balanced, making the dish taste a bit bland. Moreover, the service could have been better. The staff seemed to be in rush and did not pay much attention to customer needs. I wish they were more attentive. I hope the restaurant can improve its food quality and service in the future."

The Ratatouille was flavorful but could have been cooked a bit more, while the Crème Brûlée, although having a lovely caramelized sugar topping, was a bit too sweet for my taste. The atmosphere was indeed warm and welcoming as described in the advertisement, and the service was efficient. However, I believe there's room for improvement in terms of the food preparation and balancing of flavors."
