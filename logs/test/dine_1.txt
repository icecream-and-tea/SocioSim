    "comment": "The experience at Le Petit Gourmet was average. The Ratatouille and Tarte Tatin were both satisfactory, but not exceptional. The Ratatouille could have used a bit more seasoning to bring out the flavors of the vegetables, and the Tarte Tatin was a bit too sweet for my taste. The service was decent, but improvements could be made in terms of speed and attentiveness. I have dined at other restaurants with similar cuisine and found their dishes to be more flavorful and their service to be more efficient. I would recommend Le Petit Gourmet to expand their vegetarian options and focus on improving the balance of flavors in their dishes."
