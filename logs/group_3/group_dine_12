[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.
    ],
    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>
}
(If you want to summarize, only output this json data, without any other content!!!)

[Nate->all]: Given my income and the need to be economical, it's important to consider the prices alongside the menu options. I have a preference for grilled dishes and we are all healthy with no dietary restrictions. My meticulous nature means I will scrutinize the options carefully.

Looking at American Aroma, the BBQ Ribs and Grilled Chicken Sandwich catch my eye as they align with my preference for grilled dishes. Stars & Stripes Diner also offers BBQ Ribs, which could be a good option, especially with the 10% discount on the 'Taste of America' combo meal if the ribs are included. This could be a more cost-effective choice.

Given the financial constraints, the discount at Stars & Stripes Diner is quite appealing. However, I also want to ensure the food is delicious and the service is good. Without customer scores or comments, it's a bit of a gamble either way. I'd lean towards the place that seems to offer the best value for money, which might be Stars & Stripes Diner, considering the discount.

Vicky, what are your thoughts on the menus and the potential savings at Stars & Stripes Diner? And Steve, is there anything in particular you would like to eat from these menus? Let's discuss and see if we can come to an agreement.

[Vicky->all]: I do see the appeal of the 10% discount at Stars & Stripes Diner, especially since we have to be mindful of our budget. The 'Taste of America' combo meal might also give us a chance to try a variety of items at a reduced price, which is great. However, it's important that we also consider the overall dining experience and the quality of the food. 

Looking at the menus, I'm drawn to American Aroma's Classic American Burger and their Mac & Cheese. Comfort food is something that I always enjoy, and these dishes sound like they would hit the spot. Plus, the New York Cheesecake and Apple Pie for dessert sound delightful. I think Steve would enjoy the Mac & Cheese as well, and we could perhaps share the cheesecake as a treat.

I'm leaning towards American Aroma because their menu seems to have more options that I know we all would enjoy. Also, their advertisement about the authentic taste of America and classic delights suggests that they might be more focused on delivering that comfort food experience we're looking for.

Steve, what do you think? Is there something you fancy from one of the menus? Your opinion matters a lot in our decision. Let's try to decide together after hearing your thoughts.

[Steve->all]: Well, considering my high cholesterol and the need for low-fat options, I'm thinking the Caesar Salad at American Aroma could be a good choice for me because it's lighter than most of the other dishes. I also like that there's a grilled chicken sandwich option there, which sounds like it could be made healthier if I ask for it without bacon and the honey mustard sauce. Plus, the iced tea sounds like a refreshing drink that wouldn't be too heavy.

The Cobb Salad at Stars & Stripes Diner looks like it could be a healthy option too, but with bacon and blue cheese, it might be too high in fat for my dietary restriction. The milkshake trio is tempting, but definitely not a good idea for my cholesterol and diet.

I'm also considering the costs. The discount at Stars & Stripes Diner is certainly attractive, but it's important to eat food that's good for my health. Mom, I see your point about the comfort food at American Aroma, and Dad, I agree that the discount is appealing. However, I think we should go for the food that's healthier for me, keeping in mind my dietary needs. American Aroma seems to have a couple of options that I can tailor to be healthier.

So, I'd suggest we go to American Aroma, and I can order the Caesar Salad and Grilled Chicken Sandwich with modifications. How does that sound to both of you? We can all share an Apple Pie for dessert since it's a traditional dish and might be less heavy than the cheesecake. Shall we discuss this further or are we getting close to a decision?

[Nate->all]: I appreciate both your perspectives. Vicky, you make a good point about the comfort food options at American Aroma, and the cheesecake does sound like a nice treat. Steve, your health is certainly a top priority, and it’s important to choose a place that offers lighter options that can be adjusted to fit your dietary needs.

Considering all factors, it seems American Aroma might be the better choice for us. They have a variety of dishes that we all find appealing, and even though Stars & Stripes Diner offers a discount, the menu at American Aroma seems to cater more to our collective tastes and health considerations. Steve can modify the Grilled Chicken Sandwich to make it healthier, and we can enjoy the Classic American Burger and Mac & Cheese, which are within our budget. Sharing an Apple Pie for dessert would be a lovely way to end our meal.

Unless there are any objections or further points to discuss, I propose that we choose American Aroma for our dining experience. If we all agree, I will summarize our order and finalize our decision in the next round. Does this sound good to both of you?

[Vicky->all]: Nate and Steve, I agree with your assessments. Health is indeed important, and it's vital that we accommodate Steve's dietary needs. American Aroma does offer options that can be tailored to be healthier, which is a great point, Steve. The comfort food aspect is also something I value, and it seems we can all find something to enjoy there.

Considering our financial situation, although we won't have a discount like the one offered at Stars & Stripes Diner, it's essential that we prioritize a balanced meal that satisfies everyone's preferences and health requirements. American Aroma's menu does appear to offer that balance.

I'm content with the proposal to choose American Aroma, and I think their menu will provide us with a comforting and enjoyable dining experience. Let’s go for the Classic American Burger, Mac & Cheese, Caesar Salad, Grilled Chicken Sandwich (with the healthier modifications for Steve), and share an Apple Pie for dessert. It seems like a decision that takes all our preferences and needs into account.

If there are no more points to add, I'm ready to move forward with this decision and can summarize our order in the next round. Nate, Steve, are we ready to finalize?

Steve, needing low-fat options for his high cholesterol, found suitable dishes at American Aroma that could be modified to be healthier. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich can be adjusted to remove bacon and honey mustard, and the Caesar Salad is a lighter option. We all agreed to share an Apple Pie for dessert as a balance between indulgence and moderation. The decision was unanimous with all family members' preferences and health considerations taken into account."

[Nate->all]: The Classic American Burger was fair, nothing exceptional but edible. I'd rate it a solid 5/10. The Mac & Cheese, also fair, was a bit too bland for my taste, so that's another 5/10. The Caesar Salad, unfortunately, fell short of expectations with the dressing lacking flavor, earning it a 4/10. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was decent enough, I'll give it a 5/10. The Apple Pie was okay but could have used more spice, so I'm thinking 4/10. Overall, the meal was average, and I hoped for a bit more given the descriptions on the menu.

[Vicky]: I agree with Nate on the burger and Mac & Cheese; they were just okay. Both get a 5/10 from me. The Caesar Salad was a bit disappointing, especially since the lettuce wasn't as crisp as I like it, so it's a 4/10. I did enjoy the Grilled Chicken Sandwich a bit more, so that's a 5/10 for me. The Apple Pie was not as flavorful as I expected, so I'll say 4/10. It was an average meal, and I was hoping for a bit more comfort from the comfort food.

[Steve]: The Caesar Salad was a bit of a letdown; it lacked the punch I was looking for. It gets a 4/10 from me. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was the highlight, even with the modifications, so I'll give it a 5/10. Everything else was just mediocre. The burger and Mac & Cheese both get a 5/10, and the Apple Pie was too bland for my liking, so 4/10 for that. I was expecting healthier options to be a bit more flavorful.

[Nate]: Based on our scores and comments, it seems we're all in agreement that the meal was generally average. I'll compile our final review.

[Steve]: Dad, I really liked the Mac & Cheese last time, but I'm willing to try something new too! Maybe we can find a place with good grilled dishes since you love those.

[Nate]: I appreciate that, Steve. You're right, Vicky, our budget is important. We should also consider that we found American Aroma to be just average last time. Maybe we could try something different this time. Stars & Stripes Diner has a higher customer score, and their BBQ Ribs Platter is cheaper than American Aroma's. Plus, we could use the 10% discount mentioned in their ad.

[Vicky]: That's a good point, Nate. Stars & Stripes Diner also seems to have healthier options like the Cobb Salad, which might be a nice change for us. And the discount will definitely help with our budget.

[Vicky->all]: It seems we're leaning towards Stars & Stripes Diner. They have a variety of dishes that cater to our taste for comfort food. Steve, they have a Classic Cheeseburger and Buffalo Chicken Wings that I think you'll like. Plus, the Apple Pie à la Mode could be a sweet treat for us after the meal.

[Steve]: Yeah, that sounds good! I would love to try the cheeseburger. And the apple pie sounds delicious!

[Vicky]: Great! I think the Cobb Salad would be a good choice for me, it's healthy and filling. We could also share the Milkshake Trio as a treat. It's within our budget, especially with that 10% discount. Shall we go with Stars & Stripes Diner then?

[Nate]: I'm happy with that decision. The BBQ Ribs Platter and the discount make it a good deal. Plus, the customer reviews are positive, which gives me hope that the service will be good.

[Steve]: That settles it then! Stars & Stripes Diner it is!

[Steve]: I loved the cheeseburger, Dad! I think it was a 9! The wings were really tasty too, maybe an 8? The apple pie was good, but not the best I've had. So maybe a 7 for the pie?

[Vicky]: The Cobb Salad was fresh and the flavors were well-balanced, I'd rate it an 8. The Milkshake Trio was nice, but I expected a bit more wow-factor, so a 7 for that. Overall, a good meal at Stars & Stripes Diner.

[Nate->all]: Nate, I remember you love grilled dishes, and both restaurants have BBQ options. American Aroma has that BBQ Ribs we found just okay last time. Maybe Stars & Stripes Diner could be a better choice today with their BBQ Ribs Platter? Plus, I think Steve would enjoy the Milkshake Trio they have. What do you think?

[Vicky->all]: Nate, I agree with you on giving Stars & Stripes Diner another try. The BBQ Ribs Platter might be better than what we had previously, and I think the Cobb Salad could be a good healthy option for me. Steve, how about you? Would you be excited to try the Milkshake Trio at Stars & Stripes Diner? And we mustn't forget to mention the special dessert offer from the advertisement, it could be a nice treat for us.

[Steve->all]: Hey, Nate and Vicky, I'm definitely intrigued by the idea of the Milkshake Trio; it sounds like a treat! Considering my high cholesterol, I should probably steer clear of the BBQ Ribs Platter, even though it's tempting. The Cobb Salad at Stars & Stripes Diner seems like a healthier option for me, and it's probably lower in fat, which is good for my dietary restrictions. I'm also curious about the Southwest Veggie Burger; it might be a good choice for me as long as the lime-cilantro mayo isn't too heavy. What do you both think about trying those options? Also, that special dessert offer is too good to pass up!

[Nate->all]: Nate, Steve's suggestions seem reasonable. The Cobb Salad and Southwest Veggie Burger at Stars & Stripes Diner are healthier options for him, and we should consider that. The Milkshake Trio also seems like something he'd enjoy without it being too heavy. As for us, the BBQ Ribs Platter definitely aligns with your taste for grilled dishes. I'm keen on trying the Cobb Salad myself, and the special dessert offer sounds like a delightful end to our meal. Are we all in agreement then to go for these options at Stars & Stripes Diner?

[Nate->all]: That BBQ Ribs Platter was fantastic, really hit the spot with its smoky flavor and tenderness – I'd give it a solid 8. The Milkshake Trio was good too, not the best I've ever had, but still quite enjoyable, so let's say a 7. The Cobb Salad was fresh and the dressing was zesty, definitely a 7.5.

The Southwest Veggie Burger was a pleasant surprise; it was hearty and flavorful, so I'll also rate it 7.5.

[Nate->all]: Nate, I know we have to be careful with our spending, but I think we deserve a treat every now and then. Considering our last experiences, Stars & Stripes Diner seems to be the better option. Their BBQ Ribs Platter was a hit with us, and I think it might also be more cost-effective. What do you think?

[Vicky->all]: Nate, I agree that the BBQ Ribs Platter at Stars & Stripes Diner was indeed a highlight for us. I also noticed that they have a new American Super Salad which might be a healthier choice for us and aligns with our need to eat healthy on a budget. Plus, the diner has a higher customer score overall, which suggests consistent quality. What do you say, Steve? Would you like to go back to Stars & Stripes Diner, or would you like to give American Aroma another chance with their new menu items?

[Steve->all]: Well, considering our family's financial situation and health concerns, I think it makes sense to choose a place that offers both value and healthier options. I agree with both of you that Stars & Stripes Diner seems like a good choice. They have dishes that cater to our taste for comfort food, but also offer healthier alternatives like the American Super Salad, which might be good for my high cholesterol. Plus, we've had good experiences there before. I think the consistency and quality of the diner are important, and it looks like they're trying to offer better options for folks like us who are watching their diet. So, I'm leaning towards going back to Stars & Stripes Diner. What do you both think about giving their healthier options a try this time, alongside one of our favorites like the BBQ Ribs Platter?

[Nate->all]: I believe we're on the same page about visiting Stars & Stripes Diner again. Steve brought up a good point about the healthier options, and I think that's something we should definitely consider. The American Super Salad sounds like a great addition to our meal, giving us a balance between indulgence and health. We can get the BBQ Ribs Platter that we loved last time and pair it with the Super Salad to ensure we have a well-rounded meal. This way, we can satisfy our taste for grilled dishes while still being mindful of our health. Plus, with the diner's current promotion, we might save a little extra, which is always a plus for our budget. Shall we finalize this decision in our next round?

[Vicky->all]: I'm glad we all seem to agree on returning to Stars & Stripes Diner. It's clear that the BBQ Ribs Platter is a family favorite, and trying their new American Super Salad will add a fresh and healthy component to our meal. It's important that we continue to enjoy our meals while taking care of our health and budget. And yes, Nate, taking advantage of the promotion for the salad would be great for our finances. If there are no objections, I think we can consider this as our choice and move forward with the order in the next round. Does everyone feel comfortable with this decision?

[Nate->all]: Hey Vicky and Steve, it's time to decide where we're eating today. I'm leaning towards Stars & Stripes Diner, since we've had good experiences there before. The BBQ Ribs Platter has been a hit every time, and I'd love to have that again. Plus, the American Super Salad seems like a healthy option that we all enjoyed. What do you two think?

[Vicky->all]: I hear you, Nate, and the BBQ Ribs Platter does sound tempting again. But I'm also curious about American Aroma's Farm-to-Table Salad and the Southern Fried Chicken, which could be a nice change. The comments about their freshness and use of local ingredients are appealing, and they have a Vegan American Burger that might be a lighter option for us to try. It's important we keep our meals varied, and since we've been to Stars & Stripes Diner for the past few days, maybe it's time for a change? What do you think, Steve?

[Steve->all]: I get your point, Vicky, variety is important, and American Aroma does have some good options. But considering Steve's dietary restrictions and our recent enjoyable meals at Stars & Stripes, I'm a bit hesitant to switch. We know what to expect at Stars & Stripes, and they have dishes that cater to all our needs. Plus, their customer score is slightly higher. Steve, what's your take on this, considering your dietary needs and our previous dining experiences?

[Nate->all]: Dad, Mom, I enjoy the BBQ at Stars & Stripes Diner, and I think the American Super Salad was really fresh and tasty. I wouldn't mind going back there since I know I'll find something I like. But I'm also up for trying something new at American Aroma. Their menu sounds good, and I think it's cool they focus on local ingredients. I'm okay with either choice, but since we've been to Stars & Stripes a few times already, why not give American Aroma a chance?

[Vicky->all]: Steve, I appreciate your willingness to try something new, and I agree with you about the importance of local ingredients. Nate, I understand your preference for Stars & Stripes Diner, and it's been great for us the last few days. I feel like a change could be good for us, and American Aroma's focus on fresh, local produce is very attractive. They have a variety of dishes that could satisfy our craving for comfort food while also offering some healthier options. Shall we give American Aroma a try today and maybe order the Farm-to-Table Salad, the Southern Fried Chicken, and the Vegan American Burger for some variety? What do you say we take a vote?

[Steve->all]: I'm all for giving American Aroma a try. It's good to keep things fresh, and their menu has some appealing options that could satisfy our cravings. Steve, since you're good with either, does that mean we're in agreement to try American Aroma today?

[Nate->all]: That Farm-to-Table Salad was really good, fresh as advertised. I'd give it a solid 7.5. The Southern Fried Chicken was also tasty, a good comfort dish, I'd say another 7.5 for that. The Vegan American Burger was surprisingly flavorful for a plant-based option, and I appreciated that it's a healthier choice, so I'll score that a 7.5 as well. What do you guys think?

[Vicky->all]: I'm with you, Nate. The Farm-to-Table Salad was quite refreshing, deserving a 7.5 from me. The Southern Fried Chicken hit the spot with its homey taste, so another 7.5. And the Vegan American Burger was a pleasant surprise, it didn't feel like we were missing out on meat at all, so it gets a 7.5 too. It's nice to have such wholesome options. Steve, how did you find the meal?

[Steve->all]: The dishes were all quite satisfying, maintaining good balance between health and taste. The Farm-to-Table Salad was vibrant and flavorful, so I'll give it a 7.5. The Southern Fried Chicken was a treat, definitely comfort food that meets my taste, so that's a 7.5 as well. As for the Vegan American Burger, it was a great low-fat option that didn't skimp on flavor, so I'm happy to give it a 7.5 too. I think we made a good choice with American Aroma today. How about we round up our scores and give our final thoughts? Who wants to summarize?

[Nate->all]: Hey Vicky, Steve, we've been alternating between American Aroma and Stars & Stripes Diner for a while now. I'm thinking it might be time to shake things up a bit. Given our budget, I've been looking over both menus, and I'm leaning towards dishes that give us more bang for our buck. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this and what you've been enjoying or not enjoying so much at each place. Personally, I'm always up for a good grilled dish, and we've had some positive experiences with the BBQ Ribs at both spots. What do you think?

[Vicky->all]: Nate, you're right about the BBQ Ribs; they've been a hit with all of us at both places. But considering our budget, I think we should also consider which restaurant gives us the best value. The loyalty programs they both offer sound like a good way to save some money in the long run. I've noticed that the meals we've had at Stars & Stripes Diner have been consistently enjoyable, and their dishes are slightly cheaper. Plus, they've introduced that new Stars & Stripes Fusion Bowl, which could be a healthy and fun option since we can customize it. Steve, honey, you've been quiet. What's your take on all this?

[Steve->all]: Well, Dad and Mom, I've been paying attention to how we've been reacting to the food from both places. I like the BBQ Ribs as much as you do, Dad, but I've also got to watch the cholesterol, so I've been happy with the salads and the veggie options. Stars & Stripes Diner has that Southwest Veggie Power Burger that's really good and seems healthier than a lot of the other choices. I also think their loyalty program could help us out with the budget in the future. 

I get what you're saying about value, Mom. The Fusion Bowl at Stars & Stripes Diner could be a great way to get a meal that's both tasty and within our dietary needs. Plus, having a customizable dish means we won't get bored with the same flavors. What do you both think about going back to Stars & Stripes and trying some of these dishes along with the ribs? Dad, maybe you could try the Fusion Bowl with some grilled chicken, and Mom, they have that Cobb Salad that you liked last time. We could get a good mix of dishes without breaking the bank. What do you say?

[Nate->all]: Steve, your points about the Fusion Bowl and the Southwest Veggie Power Burger are well taken. It's important that we keep our meals not just within budget, but also healthy and interesting. I do appreciate a good BBQ Ribs platter, and Vicky, you're spot on about the value for money. I think Stars & Stripes Diner's loyalty program could really benefit us in the long term, and their lower prices are definitely a plus. 

Vicky, the Cobb Salad you enjoyed last time could be a good choice again, and I'm intrigued by the Fusion Bowl. Being able to customize it with grilled chicken sounds perfect for me—it aligns with my preference for grilled dishes. We should balance our meal with a mix of these options to keep it healthy and satisfying for everyone. If we're all in agreement, I suggest we go back to Stars & Stripes and order a variety of dishes that cater to our tastes and health goals. Shall we finalize this in our next round of discussion?

[Vicky->all]: I agree with both of you. It seems like Stars & Stripes Diner offers dishes that cater to all our preferences and health considerations. Plus, with the loyalty program and slightly lower prices, it seems like the smarter choice financially. I do enjoy a good salad, and I'm curious about trying the Fusion Bowl myself – maybe with some tofu for a change. Nate, the ribs have been consistently good there, and Steve, the veggie options do seem diverse and satisfying. 

Let's make sure we're all on the same page. We're leaning towards Stars & Stripes Diner for the variety, health-conscious options, the loyalty program benefits, and the overall value, right? If we all agree, I think we're ready to make this our choice and decide on the exact dishes to get. What do you both say?

[Nate->all]: The BBQ Ribs Platter didn't disappoint; it's always a solid choice with that smoky flavor I love. I'd give it an 8.6. The Fusion Bowl was quite good too, interesting to have it with the grilled chicken, so I'd say a 7.9. The Cobb Salad was fresh, and the flavors were on point, deserving an 8.1. The Southwest Veggie Power Burger surprised me with its taste and texture, definitely an 8.1. Overall, a very good meal with the family at Stars & Stripes Diner.

[Vicky->all]: I enjoyed the meal quite a bit. The BBQ Ribs Platter was hearty and satisfying, I'd give it an 8.6 as well. The Stars & Stripes Fusion Bowl was fresh and full of flavor, definitely a 7.9. The Cobb Salad was delightful and seemed very fresh, so an 8.1 from me too. And the Southwest Veggie Power Burger was surprisingly tasty for a healthier option, I'd rate it an 8.1. Stars & Stripes Diner continues to be a good choice for our family meals.

[Steve->all]: The dishes tonight were all quite satisfying. The BBQ Ribs Platter was really good, almost as good as Dad described it, so I'd give it an 8.6. The Fusion Bowl was a new experience, and I liked the customization aspect; it gets a 7.9 from me. Mom's Cobb Salad looked great, and from the bite I had, I'd rate it an 8.1. The Southwest Veggie Power Burger is just my kind of dish—tasty and fits with my diet, so I'll give it an 8.1. Stars & Stripes Diner did a great job once again.

[Nate->all]: Nate, given our budget constraints, I think we need to be careful with our choices. Both restaurants have dishes that appeal to our tastes, especially those grilled options you like. What do you think about the menus?

[Steve]: Dad, I really liked the BBQ Ribs from Stars & Stripes Diner last time! Can we go there again? The ribs are cheaper there, and they come with sides too!

[Nate]: That's a good point, Steve. The price is definitely a factor we need to consider, and the BBQ Ribs Platter at Stars & Stripes Diner has been a hit with us consistently. Vicky, it seems like the Stars & Stripes Diner also has healthier options like the Cobb Salad, which could be a good balance for us.

[Vicky]: True, and the Fresh Farm-to-Table Salad at American Aroma does sound appealing. It’s a tough choice, but we should consider that we’ve had good experiences at Stars & Stripes Diner multiple times now.

[Steve]: And the Apple Pie à la Mode could be a nice treat for dessert, right? Plus, if we join the loyalty program at Stars & Stripes Diner, we might save some money in the long run.

[Nate]: Agreed, the loyalty program could be beneficial. Let's also consider that the customer score for Stars & Stripes Diner is slightly higher than American Aroma, indicating that overall customer satisfaction might be better there. Given our previous experiences and the menu options that cater to our health and taste preferences, I’m leaning towards Stars & Stripes Diner. Shall we discuss this further or are we ready to make a decision?

[Vicky->all]: I think we're finding a good balance at Stars & Stripes Diner between the comfort food we love and some healthier options. The cost is also a consideration for us, and the portions at Stars & Stripes seem to provide better value for our money. Nate, the loyalty program does sound like a smart idea to save some cash in future visits.

[Steve]: Yeah, Mom! I love their ribs, and the apple pie sounds amazing.

[Nate]: It seems like we're all leaning towards Stars & Stripes Diner again. I'm in favor of sticking with what we know we'll enjoy and where we get good value. Are we ready to choose Stars & Stripes Diner and decide on our dishes?

[Vicky]: I believe so, Nate. We've had consistently good experiences there, and it fits our family's needs well. Let's go with Stars & Stripes Diner and pick our favorite dishes along with some new ones to try. 

[Steve]: I want the BBQ Ribs Platter again, please!

[Nate]: And I think the Cobb Salad for a healthier option sounds good. Vicky, what would you like to try?

[Vicky]: I'd like to try the Local Delight Burger. It sounds like a tasty option that also supports local farms, which is great. Shall we finalize our order?

[Nate->all]: Well, I have to say the BBQ Ribs Platter was good as always, though not the best we've had. I'd give it a 7.6. The Cobb Salad was fresh and the dressing was zesty - a 7.1 from me. The Local Delight Burger had a great flavor combination with the local beef, so I'll score it a 7.3. And the Apple Pie à la Mode was a solid treat, I'd say 7.1.

[Vicky]: I enjoyed the meal overall. The BBQ Ribs Platter was satisfying, earning a 7.6. The Cobb Salad was lovely with its healthiness, so a 7.1 for me too. The Local Delight Burger was quite delicious, and I'd score it a 7.3. The Apple Pie à la Mode was good but not extraordinary, so it's a 7.1.

[Steve]: Those ribs are still my favorite, I give them a 7.6! The Cobb Salad was okay, I guess, so a 7.1. The Local Delight Burger was really tasty, definitely a 7.3. And the Apple Pie à la Mode was awesome, a 7.1 for sure!

[Vicky->all]: The BBQ Ribs Platter was again a hit with me, so that's a 7.6. The Cobb Salad was good and a healthier option, which I appreciate, so it gets a 7.1. The Local Delight Burger had a nice fresh taste to it, supporting local farms is important, so I'd say a 7.3. Lastly, the Apple Pie à la Mode was the perfect end to the meal, a 7.1 for its classic flavor.

[Nate->all]: Nate, considering our budget, I think we should go for the place that offers the best value for money. We've had good experiences with both restaurants, but I've noticed that Stars & Stripes Diner has more affordable options. What do you think?

[Vicky->all]: I agree that value is important, Nate, and I also want to make sure we get a comforting meal that tastes great. Given our previous experiences, it seems like we've enjoyed the food at Stars & Stripes Diner quite a bit. The BBQ Ribs Platter has been a hit for us, and I think it would be nice to have that again. However, I'm open to trying American Aroma if you and Steve are leaning towards it for a change. What are your thoughts, Steve?

[Steve->all]: I'm all for a meal that feels like comfort food, and I've really liked the BBQ Ribs Platter at Stars & Stripes Diner. That being said, looking at American Aroma's menu, they have a lot of fresh and healthy options which might be better for my high cholesterol and low-fat diet. The Plant-Powered Protein Bowl and the American Aroma Exclusive Salad caught my eye. Plus, their customer score is slightly higher. I'd be willing to give American Aroma another shot if we can find dishes that meet all our needs there. What do you think, Dad and Mom?

[Nate->all]: Steve, I appreciate your interest in the fresh options at American Aroma. Vicky, I hear your point about the comfort food too. I must say, the American Aroma's menu does have some appealing options that could cater to our taste for grilled dishes, like their Premium BBQ Ribs and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, which might satisfy our love for grilled flavors while also giving us a chance to try something new. Balancing the budget and our palate might lead us to a compromise. If we can find a mix of dishes that are both cost-effective and align with our tastes and health needs, American Aroma might be worth a visit. Shall we give it a try and see if we can get a satisfying meal within our budget?

[Vicky->all]: Nate, I value your consideration for our budget, and Steve, I'm glad you're thinking about healthier options. American Aroma does have a slightly higher customer score, and it's nice to mix things up now and then. If we can make sure to pick dishes that are comforting, as well as fresh and healthy, then I think American Aroma could be a good choice for us tonight. We should ensure that the dishes we choose are within our budget, too. Let's look at the menu and decide on dishes that everyone will enjoy. Shall we try to finalize our decision now?

The restaurant's slightly higher customer score and the variety of fresh and healthy options appealed to us, especially considering my high cholesterol and low-fat dietary needs. The Deluxe Classic American Burger and Premium BBQ Ribs satisfy our craving for comfort food and grilled flavors, while the Grilled Chicken Sandwich offers a lean protein option. The American Aroma Exclusive Salad and Plant-Powered Protein Bowl provide the fresh and low-fat options I need. Nate emphasized the importance of finding a balance between budget and taste, and Vicky prioritized comfort food with the option to try something new. We believe American Aroma will provide a good mix of dishes that cater to all our tastes and health concerns while staying within our budget."

[Nate->all]: I was really impressed with the Premium BBQ Ribs. They had that grilled flavor I love, and the meat was cooked to perfection. The Deluxe Classic American Burger was also good, though not extraordinary. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was delicious and felt like a healthier option, which I appreciate. The American Aroma Exclusive Salad was fresh, and the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl was surprisingly satisfying. I'd give an individual score of 8 for the overall meal.

[Vicky->all]: The meal was quite satisfying overall. The Deluxe Classic American Burger was tasty and hit that comfort food spot for me. The Premium BBQ Ribs were tender and had a lovely smoky flavor; they were my favorite. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was well-prepared, and I particularly enjoyed the freshness of the American Aroma Exclusive Salad. The Plant-Powered Protein Bowl was a delightful surprise with its flavors and textures. I would rate our meal experience as an 8 out of 10.

[Steve->all]: The Plant-Powered Protein Bowl was excellent, with a great balance of flavors and a good option for my dietary needs. The American Aroma Exclusive Salad was fresh and satisfying as well. The Deluxe Classic American Burger was quite enjoyable, even though I had to be mindful of the fat content. The Premium BBQ Ribs were good, but I had to limit my intake due to my health concerns. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was another highlight for me; it was tasty and felt like a healthier choice. My individual score for the overall meal would be an 8.

[Nate->all]: The dishes we ordered at American Aroma were overall quite good. The Deluxe Classic American Burger had a nice flavor, the Premium BBQ Ribs were tender and well-seasoned, and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich was both tasty and felt like a healthier option. The freshness of the American Aroma Exclusive Salad was very much appreciated, and the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl had a great mix of flavors. I was happy with the choices we made as they catered to our taste for grilled dishes, and also offered healthier options. My score for the meal would be 8 out of 10.

[Vicky->all]: I felt the Deluxe Classic American Burger was well-made and satisfying, really capturing that classic American taste. The Premium BBQ Ribs were outstanding, with the right amount of smokiness - they were definitely a highlight. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was flavorful and a healthier option that didn't compromise on taste. The American Aroma Exclusive Salad was fresh and complemented the heavier dishes nicely, while the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl was hearty and tasty, which was a pleasant surprise. I feel comfortable giving our meal experience a score of 8 out of 10.

[Steve->all]: The Plant-Powered Protein Bowl really hit the spot with its variety of healthy ingredients and flavor-packed profile, especially for someone with my dietary restrictions. The American Aroma Exclusive Salad was crisp and refreshing, a perfect complement to the other dishes. The Deluxe Classic American Burger was quite good, but I had to be mindful of my cholesterol. The Premium BBQ Ribs were delicious, but again, I had to enjoy them in moderation. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was an excellent choice for a healthier protein. I would rate this meal an 8 out of 10 for its balance of taste and health-conscious options.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Nate->all]: Nate, given our budget constraints, I think we should carefully consider the cost-to-enjoyment ratio when choosing our meal. While the BBQ Ribs at Stars & Stripes Diner have been a hit, they are a bit pricier than some other options. The American Aroma has a few dishes that are more affordable and have received good feedback. How do you feel about this?

[Steve]: Dad, I really liked the BBQ Ribs from Stars & Stripes Diner! But I also wouldn't mind trying something new from American Aroma. Maybe we could find something tasty and healthy there too? What do you think? 

[Nate]: I appreciate both of your thoughts. It's true that we've enjoyed the ribs at Stars & Stripes Diner, and considering that I prefer grilled dishes, it's been a great option for us. However, I do think we should also consider American Aroma, especially since it seems to offer a good variety of flavors and some dishes that are a bit more wallet-friendly. Let’s look at what could be the best value for our money while still satisfying our taste for grilled dishes and keeping health in mind. We can make a decision in the next round of our discussion.

[Vicky->all]: I agree with both of you. It's important that we find a balance between cost and enjoyment. American Aroma has some appealing options that are both tasty and healthy, like the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl and the Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad, which could be good for us. Besides, their Premium BBQ Ribs might be a nice alternative to the ones we've had at Stars & Stripes Diner, possibly giving us a new flavor experience while looking after our budget. Let's take one more round of discussion to finalize our choice, considering all these aspects. What dishes are we leaning towards, and which restaurant will give us the best overall satisfaction considering our previous experiences?

[Steve->all]: Mom, Dad, I've been thinking about what both of you said. American Aroma seems to offer dishes that could meet all our needs. The Plant-Powered Protein Bowl and the Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad would be good for my low-fat diet and Dad's high cholesterol, while the Premium BBQ Ribs could be a delicious and slightly more affordable alternative to the ribs we love. Maybe we could try the Signature Seasonal Berry Crumble for dessert, it sounds like a nice treat that's not too heavy. It might be nice to try a new place and see if it can become a new favorite for us. Shall we give American Aroma a try this time?

[Nate->all]: Steve and Vicky, you both make compelling points, and I'm inclined to agree. It seems like American Aroma offers a good mix of the grilled flavors we enjoy and healthy options that cater to our dietary needs, all at a price point that's more aligned with our financial situation. The Premium BBQ Ribs will satisfy our grilled dish preference, while the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl and the Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad offer fresh and healthy choices. Additionally, the Signature Seasonal Berry Crumble would be a delightful way to end our meal on a sweet note. It's a solid plan that considers our taste, health, and budget. If we are all in agreement, I propose that we choose American Aroma for our meal today. Shall we finalize this in the next round?

[Nate->all]: The Premium BBQ Ribs were really good, almost as good as at Stars & Stripes, but slightly different which was a nice change. I'd give them an 8.3.

[Steve->all]: The dishes we had at American Aroma were definitely a hit for me. The Premium BBQ Ribs were quite good, offering a different but equally enjoyable taste compared to what we're used to; I'd rate them an 8.3.

[Nate->all]: Hey Vicky, Steve, it's time to discuss where we're going for dinner tonight. Given our previous experiences, both Stars & Stripes Diner and American Aroma have their strong points. We have enjoyed the BBQ Ribs at both places, but considering our finances, I'm leaning towards Stars & Stripes Diner because it's slightly more affordable and we've had good experiences there. What do you both think?

[Vicky->all]: Nate, I agree that we've had some good times at Stars & Stripes Diner, and I can see why the lower prices there are appealing. However, American Aroma has been offering some really fresh and healthy options that I think we all enjoyed, like their salads and the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl. It's important for us to eat healthy as well, and I feel that American Aroma might have a slight edge in that department. Plus, their customer score is slightly higher. Steve, honey, what do you think? Do you have a preference for tonight?

[Steve->all]: Well, Dad and Mom, I've been happy with both restaurants, but I'm also thinking about our health, especially with my high cholesterol. American Aroma seems to have some great low-fat options like the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl and the Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad, which could be really good for me. Plus, their Premium BBQ Ribs sound delicious! I guess the price difference isn't huge, and if we're mindful about which dishes we order, we can keep the cost reasonable. So, I'm slightly leaning towards American Aroma for tonight. Shall we talk about it more and decide on the dishes to order?

[Nate->all]: I appreciate both of your perspectives, and Steve, I'm glad you're considering your health too. It seems like American Aroma does have a tempting variety of dishes that cater to both our taste for grilled dishes and our need for healthy options. I think we can find a good balance between cost and health if we choose wisely. I'm willing to consider American Aroma if we can agree on dishes that won't break the bank. Let's have a second round of discussion to decide on which dishes we could order that would satisfy our budget and our dietary needs. What would you both suggest?

[Vicky->all]: Nate, I think we can manage our budget by selecting a mix of dishes that are both satisfying and healthy. We could go for the Premium BBQ Ribs to share since it's a favorite for all of us, and it's a hearty dish. For a healthier option, we could order the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl and the Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad. These dishes are packed with nutrients and will provide a nice balance to the ribs. If we share these between the three of us, I think we can keep the costs reasonable. What do you both think of this selection?

[Steve->all]: Mom, I think that's a great selection. Sharing the Premium BBQ Ribs sounds good to me, and I'm definitely excited to try the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl. The Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad would be a nice addition for some freshness and to keep things lighter. It's a good mix that takes care of my dietary restrictions and our budget. Dad, does this sound good to you as well?

We decided to share the ribs and complement them with the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl and the Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad, addressing both our taste preferences and health considerations. By sharing these dishes, we believe we can manage our budget effectively while enjoying a meal that caters to all our requirements."

[Nate->all]: That was a really satisfying meal. The Premium BBQ Ribs were as good as we hoped, smoky and tender. I'd give it an 8.3. The Plant-Powered Protein Bowl was surprisingly flavorful for a healthy dish, so I'm also giving that an 8.3. And the Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad was fresh and had a nice variety of ingredients, an 8.5 for me. What do you guys think?

[Vicky->all]: I completely agree with you, Nate. The Premium BBQ Ribs were perfectly cooked, and I loved the sauce, so I'd give them an 8.3 as well. The Plant-Powered Protein Bowl was a delightful surprise; the flavors really came together well, so it's an 8.3 from me too. The Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad was crisp and had a great combination of textures. It earns an 8.5 in my book. Overall, a great meal. Steve, your thoughts?

[Steve->all]: I'm really pleased with our choices tonight. The Premium BBQ Ribs had a fantastic flavor, definitely an 8 for me. The Plant-Powered Protein Bowl was filling and didn't make me miss the meat at all, so I'll give it an 8 as well. And I have to say, the Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad was just what I needed - light and tasty with an 8.5 score from me. It was a great balance of indulgence and health-conscious eating, and I'm feeling good about it! Shall we do a final review summary?

[Nate->all]: Nate, we've been to Stars & Stripes Diner quite a bit, and while the BBQ ribs are always a hit, I think we should try something different. American Aroma has been consistent too, and their Premium BBQ Ribs might be a nice change. Plus, they have healthy options which are good for us. What do you think?

[Vicky->all]: Nate, I agree that we've enjoyed Stars & Stripes Diner, but I'm also inclined to switch things up a bit. I think trying American Aroma again could be a good idea. The Premium BBQ Ribs sound appealing, and they have that Plant-Powered Protein Bowl and Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad that might be a healthier alternative for us. Their dishes seem to have a nice variety, which is important for keeping our meals interesting. Plus, the customer score is slightly higher for American Aroma. Steve, what are your thoughts on this?

[Steve->all]: I'm with you both on trying American Aroma again. I like the idea of having options that are both comforting and healthier, especially since I need to watch my cholesterol and fat intake.

It's a nice balance that fits my health needs without missing out on flavor. Plus, it's always good to have a bit of variety. Shall we give American Aroma a go tonight?

[Nate->all]: It seems we're all on the same page about giving American Aroma another shot. Their menu really does offer a good balance for our family's needs. Vicky, I know you appreciate dishes with fresh ingredients, and Steve, it's important that we keep your health in check with some lighter options. The Premium BBQ Ribs will satisfy my craving for grilled dishes, and I like the sound of their Weekly Special too—it could be a nice surprise. Let's go for a mix of the dishes we've discussed. If everyone's in agreement, I'll propose our final selection in the next round.

[Vicky->all]: It sounds like American Aroma is our choice for tonight, and we're leaning towards a selection that caters to our health, tastes, and the need for a little variety.

[Nate->all]: Hey Vicky, Steve, I've been looking at both menus and considering our budget and tastes. I'm leaning towards Stars & Stripes Diner because they have a good selection of grilled dishes like the Smoked Country Ribs, which I know I enjoy. Plus, their prices are a bit more affordable for us. What do you both think?

[Vicky]: I see your point, Nate. I also noticed that American Aroma has raised their game with some new dishes and the Premium BBQ Ribs sound tempting. They also have that Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad I liked last time. But I'm concerned about the cost. Steve, what would you like?

[Steve]: I really liked the BBQ Ribs at American Aroma, and they have that cool Weekly Special that changes, which is fun. But I also don't want us to spend too much. Maybe Stars & Stripes Diner would be okay since it's cheaper, and I do like their Heartland Beef Burger. 

[Nate]: Alright, let's think about this some more. American Aroma does have a higher customer score and they've updated some of their dishes, but Stars & Stripes Diner has been consistently good for us. Plus, with our budget, we have to be careful. Let's weigh our options and decide in the next round of discussion.

[Vicky->all]: I've been giving it some thought, and I think Stars & Stripes Diner might be the better choice for us tonight. It's true that American Aroma has some exciting new dishes, but the prices at Stars & Stripes are more in line with our budget. And we've enjoyed their food consistently in the past. The Heartland Beef Burger and Smoked Country Ribs should satisfy our craving for comfort food, and their American Bounty Salad is a healthy option that we've all liked before. Plus, the Homestead Apple Crisp is a sweet treat we can share. How does that sound to you, Nate and Steve? If we're all in agreement, I can go ahead and propose our final decision next.

[Steve->all]: Vicky, I agree with you. Stars & Stripes Diner seems like the sensible option. We've had good experiences there, and the prices are friendlier to our budget. The Smoked Country Ribs also fit my craving for something grilled. Steve, are you okay with this decision?

[Steve]: I'm good with that. The Heartland Beef Burger is something I've enjoyed before, and I'd be happy to have it again. Plus, the Homestead Apple Crisp does sound like a nice way to end our meal. I think we should go for Stars & Stripes Diner. Let's finalize this in the next round and decide on exactly what to order.

[Nate->all]: That was a satisfying meal. The Smoked Country Ribs were tender and had a good smoke flavor, I'd give them a solid 7.7. The Heartland Beef Burger was juicy and flavorful, also a 7.7 for me. The American Bounty Salad was fresh and had a nice variety of ingredients, so it's another 7.7. And the Homestead Apple Crisp was just the right amount of sweetness to finish, a 7.7 as well. Overall, I'm happy with our choice tonight.

[Vicky]: I agree with Nate, the meal was quite good. The Smoked Country Ribs were delicious, and I enjoyed the blend of smokiness and sweetness in the BBQ sauce, so I'd rate them a 7.7. The Heartland Beef Burger was cooked well, and the sauce tied everything together nicely, also a 7.7 from me. The salad was a hit with its freshness, getting another 7.7. The Homestead Apple Crisp was warm and comforting, definitely a 7.7. Stars & Stripes Diner didn't disappoint.

[Steve]: Yeah, I'm pretty happy with the food tonight. The ribs had a great flavor, definitely a 7.7 for me. The burger was tasty – good meat and nice toppings, so another 7.7. The salad was better than I expected, so it gets a 7.7. And the apple crisp was awesome, I'd love to have that again, a 7.7 for sure. Good choice, and the prices were reasonable for what we got.

[Nate->all]: Alright, Vicky and Steve, it's time to discuss where we're going to eat today. Let's go over our options again. We've been alternating between Stars & Stripes Diner and American Aroma, and both have their strengths. I love the grilled dishes, and we've been finding some healthy options at both places. We should also consider our budget, as we need to be mindful of our expenses. 

[Vicky]: I agree, Nate. We should look for something that offers us the best value for our money. I've been happy with the salads and the balance of healthy food at both restaurants. However, the Premium BBQ Ribs at American Aroma have been a favorite for all of us and they are within our budget.

[Steve]: I liked the BBQ Ribs too, but I also really enjoy the burgers and the desserts from Stars & Stripes Diner. Plus, their Weekly Star Special always brings something new and exciting to the table. It's a tough choice!

[Nate]: Let's keep in mind that the customer score is slightly higher for American Aroma, and our own past scores have been consistently high there too. The Premium BBQ Ribs have been a highlight, and they offer a good mix of grilled and healthy options, which is important for our family's diet and my personal taste. 

[Vicky]: That's a good point, Nate. And considering the special chipotle seasoning they've added to their ribs, it sounds like it would satisfy your love for grilled dishes even more. The price is a bit higher, but it seems like it's worth the extra cost for the quality we get.

[Steve]: Yeah, I think the ribs sound great, and I wouldn't mind trying the Signature Seasonal Berry Crumble with rosemary-infused ice cream for dessert. It sounds unique!

[Nate]: It seems we're leaning towards American Aroma today. Let's stay within our budget and make sure we get a well-rounded meal that includes those delicious ribs and some healthy options too. Shall we finalize our decision in the next round of discussion?

[Vicky]: That sounds good to me. Let's do that.

[Steve]: Agreed, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

[Vicky->all]: So, are we all set on going to American Aroma today? I think the ribs there will hit the spot for us all, and Vicky, they have those healthy salad options you’ve appreciated before.

[Vicky]: Yes, Nate, I'm in favor of American Aroma. The Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad caught my eye, and it's important for us to continue eating healthy. Plus, I feel like the ribs will be a comforting treat for us.

[Steve]: I'm good with American Aroma too. I really want to try that berry crumble for dessert. Let's just make sure we get enough variety so we all can enjoy the meal.

[Nate]: Alright, it's settled then. Let's pick our dishes carefully to stay within our budget. Vicky, you should make the final summary and place our order.

[Nate->all]: The Premium BBQ Ribs were just as good as we remembered, smoky and rich. I'd give them a solid 8 out of 10. The salad was a pleasant surprise, very fresh and the goat cheese was a nice touch. I'd say a 8.5 for the salad. The Berry Crumble was delightful, especially with the rosemary ice cream, a strong 8. And the Protein Bowl was hearty and satisfying, I'd give that an 8.3.

[Vicky]: I really enjoyed the meal today. The Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad was particularly good, I think it deserves an 8.5. The ribs were delicious again, so an 8 for that. The Protein Bowl was flavorful, a very good 8.3. And the Berry Crumble was just the right amount of sweet for me, so an 8 for dessert.

[Steve]: I liked everything! The ribs get an 8 from me, they were tasty but I remember them being a bit better last time. The salad was really good, I'd give it an 8.5. The Protein Bowl was more filling than I expected, so that's an 8.3, and the Berry Crumble was amazing, definitely an 8.2.

[Nate->all]: Hey family, it's time to decide where we're eating today. I've been really enjoying the grilled dishes recently, and it looks like both American Aroma and Stars & Stripes Diner have some good options. Given our budget, we should consider where we can get the best value for our money too. What do you both think?

[Vicky->all]: I agree, Nate. We've had some good meals at both places, and I've noticed that American Aroma has been consistently high in our ratings. Their BBQ Ribs have been a hit, and they've got some healthy options that I find quite satisfying, like the Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad and the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl. The Signature American Cheesecake sounds like a lovely treat for dessert too. We should keep in mind we're on a budget, but it's also important to enjoy our meal. Steve, what are your thoughts?

[Steve->all]: I'm leaning towards American Aroma. They've got dishes that fit my dietary needs, like the Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad, which sounds like it's full of flavor but still healthy for my high cholesterol. Plus, the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl seems like a hearty option that's low in fat. I know we've got to watch our spending, but it seems like American Aroma gives us a good balance between cost and sticking to our dietary restrictions. What do you guys think about going there and maybe trying some of the dishes we haven't yet? The Weekly Special could be interesting, and it's always good to have something new. Plus, we've been enjoying their food a lot lately.

[Nate->all]: I appreciate both of your inputs. It seems like we're all in favor of American Aroma, given their variety of grilled dishes and healthy options. They've certainly been able to accommodate our taste preferences consistently. While I'm conscious of our budget, I believe the value we've been getting from American Aroma in terms of food quality and service has been worth it. I propose we go there again today. We can order our favorites and maybe try the Weekly Special or the Ultimate American Fusion Bowl for something different. How does that sound for our second round of discussion?

[Vicky->all]: Nate, I like your idea of sticking with American Aroma. The Weekly Special sounds intriguing, and it's a good way to keep our meals varied. The Ultimate American Fusion Bowl could be a nice change too. I think we're getting great value for our money with the quality of the food and service they offer. It's important that we all enjoy our meal, and it seems we're consistently happy with what we get at American Aroma. If we're careful with our choices, we can stay within our budget. Shall we decide on the dishes in the next round then?

[Steve->all]: I'm in agreement. American Aroma it is! I'm excited to try the Weekly Special alongside our favorites. It's nice to change things up while still choosing dishes that align with my dietary needs. Nate, Vicky, it seems like we're all on the same page with our choice. We can finalize our order next. I'm looking forward to another enjoyable meal with you both at American Aroma. Let's make our final decision in the next round of discussion.

[Nate->all]: I've been looking over our past experiences and the current offerings, and I'm leaning towards American Aroma again. Their Premium BBQ Ribs have been a hit with us consistently, and given my preference for grilled dishes, I think it's a solid choice. However, I also noticed their new dessert, the American Indulgence Chocolate Cake, which might be a nice change. What do you both think?

[Vicky]: I agree that American Aroma has been great for us. I've really enjoyed their salads, and the Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad sounds like it's worth a try. The Plant-Powered Protein Bowl also caught my eye, as it fits our need for healthful options. The budget is tight, but it looks like we can manage if we're careful with our selections.

[Steve]: I love the ribs at American Aroma, but I also remember that Stars & Stripes Diner had some great desserts. That Cinnamon Orchard Apple Crisp sounds really good. But I'm happy with either place as long as I can get some tasty ribs!

[Nate]: It seems we all have a soft spot for American Aroma, especially for those ribs. Vicky, the salad and protein bowl you mentioned do sound like they complement the ribs well for a balanced meal. And Steve, I think trying a new dessert there like the chocolate cake might be just as exciting as the apple crisp at the Diner. Let's lean towards a healthy but satisfying meal that stays within our budget. Shall we finalize our choice in the next round?

[Vicky->all]: You're right, Nate, American Aroma has been a consistent winner for us, and it does offer that balance between comfort and health that I'm always looking for. Steve, I know how much you enjoy a good dessert, and I think the American Indulgence Chocolate Cake could be a real treat for us. I think we should stick with what we've been enjoying, and American Aroma seems to be the best fit for our family's needs and preferences. If we're all in agreement, I suggest we go with American Aroma for our meal. Let's decide on the dishes in the next round of our discussion.

[Steve->all]: I'm all for the ribs at American Aroma, and trying out their new chocolate cake sounds like a delicious plan. The Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad and the Plant-Powered Protein Bowl seem like good picks to balance our meal, considering my low-fat diet and high cholesterol. We've been happy with American Aroma's food and service, so I'm on board with going there again. Let's make a final decision next round and pick our dishes!

[Nate->all]: The ribs were good, not outstanding but definitely satisfying with a 7.9 score from me. The Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad was excellent, really fresh and the dressing was zesty; I'd give it an 8.5. The Protein Bowl was quite good too, a solid 8.1. The chocolate cake was rich and decadent, maybe a tad too sweet for my liking, so it's a 7.8. Overall, a really good meal that met our family's needs.

[Vicky]: I thoroughly enjoyed the salad; it's a 9 for me because it was just bursting with flavor. The Protein Bowl didn't disappoint either, I'd rate it an 8.2. The ribs were delicious and well-seasoned, so they get an 8 from me. The chocolate cake was lovely, but a little heavy after the meal, so it's a 7.7. American Aroma has done it again for our family!

[Steve]: Those ribs were awesome, I'd definitely give them an 8. The salad was surprisingly tasty too, even for a kid like me, so that's an 8.3. The Protein Bowl was good, healthy stuff but not my favorite, I'll say 7.9. The chocolate cake was the bomb, I'd give that an 8.2. I'm happy we went back to American Aroma.

[Vicky->all]: I think the meal was quite balanced and each dish brought something to the table. The BBQ Ribs were good, and I'm happy with a 7.9. The Enhanced Farm-to-Table Salad was the highlight for me, so fresh and flavorful, easily a 9. The Protein Bowl was more than satisfactory, offering a variety of textures and tastes, I'll give it an 8.3. The Chocolate Cake was indulgent, albeit a bit too rich after such a meal, scoring it a 7.8 for me. American Aroma really caters to our family's palate and health needs very well.
