[Olivia->all]: Considering my preference for Mediterranean cuisine, neither Classic American Bistro nor American Flavors USA seems to be a perfect fit in terms of cuisine type. However, I do appreciate that both offer some lighter fare which can be adapted to my dietary needs.

From Classic American Bistro, the Grilled Salmon appears to be a dish that I can enjoy, given that it's likely to be gluten-free and fits within the realm of Mediterranean flavors with its lemon herb butter sauce. Similarly, the Caesar Salad might be suitable if the croutons are omitted to accommodate my gluten allergy.

At American Flavors USA, the Cobb Salad could be a good choice, as it contains a variety of ingredients that align with a Mediterranean diet such as mixed greens, avocado, and eggs. I would need to ensure no bread or gluten-containing items are mixed in.

Both restaurants offer a New York Cheesecake and while it's a tempting dessert, I would have to inquire about a gluten-free option or possibly skip dessert due to my dietary restrictions.

Based on the information provided, I'm leaning towards Classic American Bistro because their Grilled Salmon dish seems more in line with my Mediterranean taste preferences and the possibility of modifying the Caesar Salad to be gluten-free. However, I am open to other opinions before making a final decision.

[Charlie->all]: Given my healthy lifestyle and picky nature, I am inclined towards options that offer fresh, high-quality ingredients, particularly when it comes to sandwiches and salads. At Classic American Bistro, the Caesar Salad catches my eye as a dish I usually enjoy, provided that it is made with care and quality ingredients. Additionally, the Pulled Pork Sandwich could be a delightful choice if the pork is well-cooked and the BBQ sauce is not too overpowering.

On the other hand, American Flavors USA offers a Cobb Salad that sounds quite appetizing, with a mix of ingredients that should be both flavorful and satisfying. Their Pulled Pork Sandwich is also appealing, especially since it is slightly less expensive than the one at Classic American Bistro, which could suggest a better value for the money.

Given that both restaurants have similar offerings and no customer scores or comments to differentiate them, my decision will come down to the quality and freshness of the ingredients, as well as the potential for a satisfying meal that aligns with my tastes. At this point, I am leaning towards American Flavors USA for their Cobb Salad, which seems to offer a more diverse range of ingredients, and their more reasonably priced Pulled Pork Sandwich. That said, I'm open to hearing more from others and reaching a consensus before we make a final decision.

[Olivia->all]: Charlie, I appreciate your insights, especially regarding the quality and freshness of ingredients, which are certainly important to me as well. It sounds like we both have an interest in salads, but our main course preferences differ slightly. While you're considering the pulled pork sandwich, I'm more drawn to the grilled salmon.

I agree that the Cobb Salad at American Flavors USA seems diverse and could be a delightful choice. However, given my gluten allergy, I would have to ensure there's no cross-contamination or gluten-containing ingredients in any dish I order.

Considering your preference for a quality sandwich and my inclination towards the salmon, perhaps we could find a compromise. If we choose Classic American Bistro, I could enjoy the grilled salmon as a Mediterranean-inspired dish and have the Caesar Salad modified to be gluten-free. You could try the Pulled Pork Sandwich there and share your thoughts on its quality. Additionally, we could inquire about the freshness of their ingredients to ensure they meet your standards.

What are your thoughts on this suggestion? Would you be willing to try Classic American Bistro with these options in mind, or do you have a strong preference for American Flavors USA based on the menu and pricing?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I appreciate your consideration of both our dietary preferences. While I am quite picky and focus on the quality and freshness of the ingredients, I am also flexible and can adapt to different menus. The grilled salmon at Classic American Bistro does indeed sound like a healthy and appetizing choice that aligns with your Mediterranean preference.

I am willing to compromise and agree to your suggestion of trying Classic American Bistro. I can select the Caesar Salad, ensuring it is prepared to my liking, and give the Pulled Pork Sandwich a chance, hoping that it lives up to my expectations. Your choice of the Grilled Salmon also sounds delightful, and I am curious to see if it meets your gluten-free requirements.

Since both of us find suitable options at Classic American Bistro and considering their menu seems to cater a bit more to our combined preferences, I am happy to finalize our decision to dine there. We can also inquire about their commitment to fresh ingredients, which will hopefully satisfy my pickiness regarding food quality.

If you agree with this, we can proceed to the next round and make our final decision.

[Olivia->all]: Reflecting on our meal at Classic American Bistro, I found the Grilled Salmon to be fair; it was cooked properly but lacked that Mediterranean flair I was looking for. It met my dietary needs, which is a plus. My score for the Grilled Salmon would be a 6 out of 10. The Caesar Salad, which was adapted to be gluten-free, was decent. It was fresh but nothing extraordinary; therefore, I'd rate it a 5 out of 10. Overall, my experience was acceptable, but there's room for improvement in taste and authenticity towards Mediterranean cuisine.

[Charlie->all]: The meal at Classic American Bistro was generally fair, though not quite up to my expectations for freshness and flavor. The Caesar Salad had fresh ingredients, but it wasn't particularly outstanding, so I would rate it a 5.5 out of 10. The Pulled Pork Sandwich had a fair balance of flavors and the pork was tender, but again, it didn't impress me as much as I had hoped, so I'll give it a 6 out of 10. While the ingredients seemed fresh enough, the overall culinary execution could have been better to meet my picky standards.

[Olivia->all]: After our experience at Classic American Bistro, I have to say the dishes were fair overall. The Grilled Salmon was decent, satisfactorily meeting my gluten-free needs, but it didn't deliver the punch of Mediterranean flavors I was craving. Hence, I'll give it a 6 out of 10. The Caesar Salad was modified to be gluten-free, which I appreciate, but as far as taste goes, it was quite ordinary, so it gets a 5 out of 10. It was an adequate meal, but I had higher expectations for flavor and a more authentic Mediterranean influence.

[Charlie->all]: The meal at Classic American Bistro was overall satisfactory. The Caesar Salad was fresh, but not particularly exceptional, earning it a 5.5 out of 10 from me. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was tender and had a nice flavor balance, but it didn't particularly stand out, so I'll give it a 6 out of 10. The freshness of the ingredients was noticeable, which I valued, but the culinary execution left something to be desired for someone with my picky tendencies. 

In the next round, one of us should summarize our collective experience and provide a final review in the required JSON format.

[Olivia->all]: I would like to start by expressing my personal needs and preferences for our next dining experience. Given my fondness for Mediterranean cuisine and my requirement for gluten-free options due to my health restrictions, I think it's essential we choose a restaurant that offers dishes catering to these criteria. Additionally, my artistic nature draws me to a place that offers not just food but also a culinary art experience, which means the presentation and creativity in flavor combinations are important to me. 

From our previous experience at Classic American Bistro, I feel that while they met dietary needs, they fell short in delivering the Mediterranean flavors I crave and the level of culinary execution I was expecting. Reviewing the menu from American Flavors USA, I notice they have a Zesty Black Bean Burger which could potentially be made gluten-free if the bun is adapted, and the Cobb Salad that could be customized to a Mediterranean taste with some alterations. Their advertisement also suggests a sense of culinary adventure, which is appealing to me.

I'm open to hearing the rest of the group's preferences and health requirements so we can make a well-informed decision together.

[Charlie->all]: Well, given my preferences for sandwiches and salads and being quite picky about the flavors, I would lean towards options that offer a fresh and high-quality taste. I don't have any dietary restrictions, and health-wise, I'm looking for something that aligns with a healthy diet. My affluent income allows me to indulge in a bit more expensive dishes, but they really need to be worth the price in terms of quality and taste.

Looking at our options, the Caesar Salad from Classic American Bistro might be a good pick for me, especially since I'm quite fond of sandwiches and salads. However, the comments about the lack of exceptional flavor and culinary execution are concerning. On the other hand, American Flavors USA offers a Cobb Salad that's described as having more zest, which might satisfy my picky palate. Their Zesty Black Bean Burger also catches my attention, especially if it's as flavorful as advertised.

While I'm not opposed to revisiting Classic American Bistro, I'm inclined to try American Flavors USA this time around, hoping their dishes will have the deliciousness and high quality I'm looking for. I'm curious to see what the others in our group think and whether they have any preferences that might sway the final decision. Let's try to find a place that satisfies everyone's taste buds and dietary needs.

[Olivia->all]: I appreciate your input, Charlie. It seems we both have a keen interest in the quality and flavor of our meals. While Classic American Bistro has options that could satisfy basic dietary needs, I am also intrigued by the fresh approach that American Flavors USA appears to offer, especially with the zesty and potentially gluten-free adaptations they might accommodate.

Since our budget allows for a bit of experimentation, I think it would be worth trying American Flavors USA to see if they can indeed provide a meal that is both artistically pleasing and suitable for my gluten-free Mediterranean preference. The prospect of a Cobb Salad with a Mediterranean twist and a gluten-free Zesty Black Bean Burger sounds promising.

However, I do want to emphasize the importance of ensuring that my meal is gluten-free, so we should inquire about that before making a final decision. Let's see if anyone else in our group has additional thoughts or requirements before we move forward with a proposal.

[Charlie->all]: It seems we're on the same page, Olivia, with an interest in a restaurant that can offer both flavorful and health-conscious options. Classic American Bistro did not quite meet our expectations previously, and I'm also intrigued by what American Flavors USA has to offer. The zesty flavors and the potential for a satisfying salad that fits my taste preference are appealing.

Given that we're both inclined towards American Flavors USA, and considering our group's previous experiences and current desires, it seems like a suitable choice. I'm also curious about the quality of their salads and sandwiches, which are my preferred types of dishes. The fact that American Flavors USA has a slightly lower customer score than Classic American Bistro does give me pause, but it seems like this could be attributed to their dishes lacking distinction rather than a significant issue with flavor or quality.

I would suggest we consider trying American Flavors USA, ensuring we communicate our specific dietary needs and preferences to them. We should emphasize the need for a gluten-free meal for you, Olivia, and I'll be looking for that fresh, high-quality taste in my salad and sandwich. If everyone agrees, I think we could have a more satisfying dining experience there this time around. Shall we see if the others are in agreement or if they have any other preferences or insights to share before we make our final decision?

[Olivia->all]: The Zesty Black Bean Burger was quite a delightful surprise, offering a robust flavor that exceeded my expectations for a gluten-free option. The burger was well-seasoned, and the avocado and tomato salsa added a refreshing touch that complemented the patty perfectly. It was a good representation of a healthier, artistic take on traditional American cuisine. I would rate it an 8 out of 10.

As for the Cobb Salad, it was a fair attempt at infusing Mediterranean flavors into an American classic. The fresh ingredients and the zippy house dressing gave the dish a nice zest, although I found it could have benefited from a bit more creativity in the choice of ingredients to truly capture the essence of Mediterranean cuisine. I give the Cobb Salad a 7.7 out of 10.

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with our meal at American Flavors USA. The service was attentive, and they were accommodating with my dietary restrictions, which is always appreciated. I'm looking forward to hearing what the rest of the group thought about their dishes.

[Charlie->all]: The Zesty Black Bean Burger was impressive; the flavors were well-balanced and the presentation was appealing. The quality certainly matched the price, and I appreciated the healthy profile of the dish. I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10 for being a delicious and satisfying meal.

Moving on to the Cobb Salad, it was quite refreshing with its zesty dressing and the combination of textures from the different ingredients was pleasing. It seemed to be a healthier option without compromising on taste. I believe it deserves a 7.7 out of 10, as it was good but not exceptional.

American Flavors USA managed to provide a meal that was both healthy and tasty, catering to my picky taste and aligning with my preference for sandwiches and salads. The service was also commendable, making it a pleasant dining experience overall. Let's see how the others in our group felt about their meals before we come to a consensus for the final review.

[Olivia->all]: It seems that both the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Cobb Salad from American Flavors USA were quite satisfactory. The burger, in particular, was a standout with its robust flavors and gluten-free accommodation, which perfectly suited my dietary restrictions. I'm pleased with the balance of health-conscious ingredients and the artistic presentation, which aligns well with my personality.

The Cobb Salad, while not completely hitting the mark for a Mediterranean flair, was still enjoyable with its fresh ingredients and zesty dressing. The overall experience at American Flavors USA was a positive one, with commendable service and dishes that catered well to our group's diverse preferences.

Based on the individual scores we've provided, I think we can come to a consensus on the overall experience at American Flavors USA. Shall we proceed with summarizing our final review in the required format?

[Charlie->all]: I agree with both Olivia and Charlie; the Zesty Black Bean Burger was quite good, with a well-balanced flavor profile, and the healthy aspect was definitely a plus for me. I would rate it an 8 out of 10 as well. The Cobb Salad was refreshing and the zesty dressing added a nice touch, though I felt it could have been a bit more innovative. My score for the Cobb Salad would be a 7.7 out of 10.

American Flavors USA seems to have delivered on their promise of an upgraded taste adventure. The restaurant managed to cater to our health-conscious approach while still providing dishes that were satisfying for a picky eater like myself. The service was also in line with our expectations, which contributes to a positive dining experience.

Given our individual scores and comments, I believe we're ready to summarize our final review. Shall I take the lead and compose our group's review in the JSON format as required for the second round?

[Olivia->all]: Given my preference for Mediterranean cuisine and the need for gluten-free options due to my allergies, I would like to suggest that we consider the options at American Flavors USA. Yesterday’s experience was quite positive, and they offer a Zesty Black Bean Burger that seems to cater to health-conscious patrons. Additionally, their Cobb Salad could be a good fit for my dietary restrictions. The customer score is also higher for American Flavors USA compared to Classic American Bistro. Charlie, what are your thoughts, and do you have any dietary preferences or restrictions we should consider?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I appreciate your suggestion and I'm inclined to agree with you. As a picky eater with a healthy appetite for sandwiches and salads, American Flavors USA seems like it could be a good fit.

[Olivia->all]: Given my preference for Mediterranean cuisine, my need for gluten-free options due to allergies, and my artistic personality which appreciates creative and flavorful dishes, I am inclined towards a restaurant that can cater to these requirements. Based on previous experiences, American Flavors USA has consistently provided dishes that are more aligned with my tastes, offering flavorful and health-conscious options, and their service has been commendable.

Classic American Bistro has a new item, The American Dream Burger, which sounds tempting, but overall, my past experiences there have been just fair, and the menu doesn't seem to have many options that cater to my Mediterranean preference or gluten-free needs. Their customer score is also lower compared to American Flavors USA.

So, I would suggest that we give American Flavors USA another visit as they have a variety of dishes that can accommodate our dietary restrictions and seem to have a knack for delivering a satisfying dining experience. Their Zesty Black Bean Burger and Southwest Spiced Steak have been particularly impressive during previous visits, and they have other options that appear to be both health-conscious and full of flavor, which is important to me.

Charlie, what are your thoughts on this, given our previous experiences and my dietary needs? Do you think American Flavors USA would be a good choice again, or do you have a different preference this time?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I appreciate your insights and I can see why American Flavors USA is appealing to you, especially considering your gluten-free needs and preference for Mediterranean flavors. On my end, I have a penchant for sandwiches and salads and I prioritize healthy eating. I'm quite picky and I look for meals that are well-prepared and flavorsome.

Reflecting on our past experiences, American Flavors USA seems to have a slight edge with their offerings. Their Zesty Black Bean Burger and Cobb Salad have been satisfying my taste for both sandwiches and salads, and they've been consistent in terms of flavor and service. Moreover, the customer score for American Flavors USA is higher than Classic American Bistro, which indicates a generally better dining experience.

While Classic American Bistro has introduced The American Dream Burger, which does sound appealing, I'm a bit hesitant since our previous experience there was not exceptional. Given that I'm quite discerning about my meals, I lean towards a restaurant that has proven to deliver on taste and quality.

Therefore, I'm inclined to agree with your suggestion to visit American Flavors USA again. However, I'm open to hearing if anyone has a different perspective or if there are specific dishes at Classic American Bistro that might meet our collective preferences before we make a final decision. What do you all think?

[Olivia->all]: I appreciate both of your inputs, Olivia and Charlie. It seems that we are all looking for a place that offers not only tasty and healthy options but also caters to specific dietary needs. Given Olivia's preference for Mediterranean flavors and gluten-free options, and Charlie's focus on well-prepared, flavorsome meals, American Flavors USA definitely stands out as the better choice.

Their Zesty Black Bean Burger and Cobb Salad were hits during our previous visits, and they offer a variety of other dishes that could appeal to our tastes. The higher customer score also suggests a more consistent and enjoyable dining experience. While the new American Dream Burger at Classic American Bistro is intriguing, it's not enough to sway our decision based on our past experiences and individual preferences.

If no one has any further objections or alternative suggestions, I propose that we go to American Flavors USA for our meal. Shall we discuss which dishes to order to ensure we all have a delightful dining experience?

[Charlie->all]: I think we're in agreement that American Flavors USA is the place to go, considering our past positive experiences and their ability to cater to our preferences and dietary needs. I have enjoyed their Zesty Black Bean Burger and Cobb Salad before, and they align with my taste for sandwiches and salads, as well as my focus on healthy eating. The customer scores reinforce our good experiences, suggesting that we're likely to have another enjoyable meal there.

As we're leaning towards American Flavors USA, I'm particularly interested in trying the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers this time, as they seem like a healthy and flavorful option that fits within my preference for salads and sandwiches when considering the overall balance of a meal. I think it could be a good addition to our order, alongside the dishes we've previously enjoyed.

If everyone is on board, we can start thinking about which dishes to select to accommodate all of our tastes and dietary considerations. Shall we proceed with finalizing our choices for American Flavors USA?

[Olivia->all]: Since we're all in agreement about choosing American Flavors USA for its consistency in flavor, service, and ability to meet our dietary needs, let's decide on the dishes. I suggest we include the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Cobb Salad, as they have been favorites in the past. Charlie's interest in the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers is a great idea—they should bring a nice variety to our meal.

Considering my dietary restrictions, I want to ensure that the dishes I select are gluten-free. Therefore, I will avoid any breaded items or dishes that typically contain gluten. Additionally, I would love to try something that aligns with my Mediterranean taste—perhaps the Southwest Spiced Steak might be a good choice, given its previous positive reception and the fact that it doesn't inherently contain gluten.

Let's round out our meal with some healthy side options and possibly a dessert that meets our dietary requirements. What does everyone think about this proposal? Shall we finalize our dishes based on these considerations?

Let's hear if anyone has any specific dish suggestions or other input before we make a final decision.

Their selection has been consistently aligned with my preference for sandwiches and salads, and I'm particularly interested in maintaining a healthy diet, which they seem to accommodate very well. Since I've previously enjoyed the Zesty Black Bean Burger, I'm curious about the Grilled Portobello Burger that Olivia mentioned, as it appears to be another healthful and flavorful option.

[Olivia->all]: Given my preference for Mediterranean cuisine and the need to accommodate my gluten-free diet due to allergies, I am inclined to suggest we visit Classic American Bistro. Despite American Flavors USA's higher customer score and my satisfying past experiences there, I am intrigued by the new offerings at Classic American Bistro, especially since they've included gluten-free options such as the Seasonal Berry Cheesecake and the Superfood Caesar Salad, which could potentially meet my Mediterranean flavor preferences.

Charlie, considering our previous experiences, would you be open to trying Classic American Bistro again to see if they've improved with their new menu items? I'm particularly interested in their Smashed Avocado Classic Burger, which seems like it could be a delightful dish if they can deliver on flavor this time around. What are your thoughts?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I appreciate your interest in giving Classic American Bistro another chance with their new menu items. As someone with a taste for sandwiches and salads, the Superfood Caesar Salad definitely catches my eye, and their Smashed Avocado Classic Burger sounds like it could be quite delicious if prepared well.

However, I must admit that my previous experiences at American Flavors USA have been consistently good, especially their Zesty Black Bean Burger and Cobb Salad, which aligns well with my preferences for sandwiches and salads. Given our history of satisfactory meals there and the fact that I am quite picky with flavors, I'm slightly more inclined to choose American Flavors USA for those reasons.

Ultimately, I'm open to exploring and would be happy to consider Classic American Bistro's new offerings if you believe they have truly stepped up their game in terms of flavor. Let's weigh our options and decide which establishment could provide us with a better dining experience today. What are your further thoughts?

[Olivia->all]: Charlie, I understand your preference for the consistent quality we've experienced at American Flavors USA, and I agree that their Zesty Black Bean Burger and Cobb Salad have been delightful. However, I believe it's essential to explore new flavors and give Classic American Bistro a chance to impress us with their latest menu. The Superfood Caesar Salad could be a fresh twist on a classic, aligning with our health-conscious choices, and the gluten-free options like the Seasonal Berry Cheesecake align with my dietary restrictions.

Moreover, I feel the artistic ambiance and the potential for culinary creativity at Classic American Bistro may resonate with my artistic personality. I'd love to see if they have indeed elevated their dishes, especially since they're advertising bold and innovative flavors.

Would you be open to trying Classic American Bistro today to see if their revamped menu reflects the improvement we're hoping for? If we find that their dishes have improved in flavor and presentation, it could be a delightful surprise and add a new favorite to our list. Shall we take this culinary adventure together and see what Classic American Bistro has to offer?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, your points about exploring new flavors and giving Classic American Bistro a chance to surprise us with their revamped menu are quite compelling. The idea of innovative flavors combined with health-conscious options like the Superfood Caesar Salad is tempting, and as a picky eater, I'm always in search of dishes that can meet my high standards for deliciousness.

While I have enjoyed consistent quality at American Flavors USA, I'm intrigued by the possibility of Classic American Bistro stepping up their game. It's important to me that we both enjoy our meal, and considering your dietary restrictions, the gluten-free options at Classic American Bistro are certainly a plus.

Let's take the chance on Classic American Bistro today. I'm curious about their Smashed Avocado Classic Burger, and the Seasonal Berry Cheesecake sounds like a delightful way to end our meal. If they've improved as they claim, it could indeed be a delightful surprise. So, I'm in agreement to try Classic American Bistro's new menu and see if they live up to the bold flavors they're promising. Shall we proceed with this selection?

[Olivia->all]: The dishes we tried at Classic American Bistro today were fair, each deserving a score of 7. The Smashed Avocado Classic Burger had a good texture, though I was expecting a bit more punch from the flavors. The Superfood Caesar Salad was fresh and the ingredients were high-quality, but it could use a more dynamic dressing. As for the Seasonal Berry Cheesecake, it was a delight with its gluten-free almond crust. The Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon was cooked well, but I felt the glaze could have been more robust. Overall, a satisfactory meal, but it lacked the 'wow' factor we were anticipating. Charlie, what's your take on the meal?

[Charlie->all]: The dishes at Classic American Bistro were quite fair, with each earning a score of 7 in my view. The Smashed Avocado Classic Burger was decent, though it didn't quite meet my picky standards for taste. The Superfood Caesar Salad, while healthy and aligned with my preferences, could have benefited from a more flavorful dressing to elevate it. The Seasonal Berry Cheesecake was enjoyable, particularly the gluten-free aspect, which I appreciate even without dietary restrictions. The Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon was satisfactory, but the flavor didn't stand out as much as I hoped. The meal was generally good but did not surpass the experiences we've had at American Flavors USA. Olivia, shall we move to summarizing our final review?

[Olivia->all]: Given my affluent income, artistic personality, and my preference for Mediterranean cuisine, I feel that Classic American Bistro's menu might not align well with my tastes, despite the gluten-free options. I've also noted from past experiences that while their dishes meet dietary needs, they often lack the exceptional flavor I crave. On the other hand, American Flavors USA has consistently provided flavorful dishes that cater to health-conscious and gluten-free diets, which suggests they might better accommodate my allergies and dietary restrictions. Their use of spices and the variety of their menu seems more in line with my Mediterranean preference.

Moreover, my previous experiences at American Flavors USA have been quite positive, with scores of 8 across multiple visits. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken were particularly enjoyable. The customer score for American Flavors USA is also notably higher than that of Classic American Bistro.

Charlie, considering our consistent satisfaction with American Flavors USA, I propose we visit them again. Would you agree, or do you have a different preference today?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I appreciate your thorough analysis and I'm inclined to agree with you. My previous experiences at American Flavors USA have indeed been satisfying, with their Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken standing out as favorites. Given my picky nature, I find their consistent quality and flavorful offerings to be particularly appealing. The salads, like the Cobb Salad, also align with my taste for sandwiches and salads.

Classic American Bistro, while it has its merits, seems to have fallen short in terms of culinary excitement and flavor depth based on our past experiences. Additionally, American Flavors USA also seems to offer a menu that is both health-conscious and without dietary restrictions, which suits my healthy lifestyle.

Unless you have any additional insights or preferences today, I would be happy to go with American Flavors USA for our meal. Shall we discuss which dishes to order in the next round of our discussion?

[Olivia->all]: Charlie, I'm delighted to hear that we're on the same page regarding American Flavors USA. Considering our past positive experiences and their menu that seems to offer a little adventurous twist with each dish, it's the preferable choice for us. I'm leaning towards ordering some of the dishes we've previously enjoyed, like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, as they cater to both our taste and dietary needs. However, I'm also curious about trying something new, perhaps the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, which sounds delightful.

I also believe that trying a variety of dishes will align with my artistic inclination towards experiencing diverse flavors and textures. What do you think about this approach, Charlie? And are there any specific dishes you would like to add or try this time around?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I'm glad we're in agreement about choosing American Flavors USA. Your suggestion to try the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp sounds excellent, and it would indeed add a new flavor profile to our meal. In terms of adding to our order, I'd like to suggest we include the Cobb Salad for a fresh and healthy option that aligns with my preference for salads. It's been a hit in the past, so I see no reason why it wouldn't be a pleasant addition to our meal today.

As for trying something new, aside from the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, perhaps we could consider the Grilled Portobello Burger. It would offer a vegetarian alternative that seems hearty and is likely to be prepared with care, given the consistent quality we've experienced at this restaurant.

If this selection sounds good to you, we could finalize our order in the next round. What are your thoughts?

[Olivia->all]: Given my personal preferences for Mediterranean cuisine, my need for gluten-free options due to allergies, my artistic personality, and the previous dining experiences recorded, I suggest we discuss the potential for dining at American Flavors USA. They have consistently met my gluten-free needs and have provided dishes with flavors that seem to align with my taste for complex and bold seasonings. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and the Zesty Black Bean Burger were particularly enjoyable. I'm leaning towards this restaurant again, but I'd like to hear your thoughts and preferences to ensure we make a decision that suits us all. Charlie, what are your thoughts?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I appreciate your suggestion and I agree that American Flavors USA has been meeting our expectations with their health-conscious and flavorful dishes. Since I am quite picky with my food, especially favoring sandwiches and salads for their fresh ingredients, and considering that we've had positive experiences with American Flavors USA's offerings like the Cobb Salad and the Zesty Black Bean Burger, it seems like a reliable choice. I'm inclined to support returning to American Flavors USA since their menu aligns with my tastes and they have shown consistent quality and service. Shall we look into possibly trying some new dishes from their menu this time around to add a bit of variety to our experience? What do you think about that?

[Olivia->all]: Charlie, I'm glad to hear that you're also enjoying our meals at American Flavors USA. Exploring new dishes sounds like a fantastic idea, as it will cater to our adventurous and artistic sides. Maybe we could consider the Harvest Veggie Stack for its variety of grilled vegetables and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp for a different yet health-conscious choice. They both sound like they could offer a new and enjoyable taste experience while still adhering to our dietary preferences. Additionally, we could revisit one of our favorites for comfort. Let's decide on the dishes once we've heard from the others as well. What do the rest of you think?

[Charlie->all]: I'm quite content with the idea of returning to American Flavors USA. My experiences there have been consistently good, with dishes that fit both my preference for sandwiches and salads and my focus on healthy eating. I'm particularly fond of the Zesty Black Bean Burger, which I've enjoyed before, and the Cobb Salad aligns well with my tastes. Trying new dishes like the Harvest Veggie Stack and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp could be a delightful change, ensuring a varied dining experience while still meeting health-conscious standards. I'd say let's finalize our decision to dine at American Flavors USA and select a mix of new dishes along with our tried-and-true favorites.

[Olivia->all]: Given my affinity for Mediterranean cuisine and the need for gluten-free options due to my allergies, I've had consistently positive experiences with American Flavors USA. Their menu items, such as the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, have been delightful and catered to both my dietary restrictions and taste preferences. Additionally, the service and culinary execution have been commendable.

While Classic American Bistro offers a few dishes that might appeal to me, such as the Seasonal Berry Cheesecake on a gluten-free almond crust, the overall experiences there have been less impressive in terms of flavor and culinary creativity, which is important for my artistic personality.

Considering these aspects and our previous dining experiences, I lean towards choosing American Flavors USA once again. Charlie, what are your thoughts?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I'm glad to see that American Flavors USA has been hitting the mark for you consistently, especially with your dietary needs. I must say, my experiences there have been quite satisfying as well. Their focus on flavor-packed, health-conscious dishes aligns perfectly with my preference for sandwiches and salads that are both delicious and nutritious. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Cobb Salad have been particularly good, and I appreciate their commitment to quality ingredients and service.

On the other hand, Classic American Bistro, despite its enticing menu options like the Energizing Superfood Caesar and the Garden Harvest Veggie Burger, seems to fall short when it comes to that extra flair in their dishes—which is something I value given my picky nature.

With all this in mind, I'm also inclined to go with American Flavors USA for our next meal. Their higher customer score and positive comments across the board give me confidence that we'll enjoy another great dining experience there. Shall we move to the next round of our discussion and consider potential dish selections from American Flavors USA?

[Olivia->all]: Absolutely, Charlie. I'm glad we're on the same page regarding American Flavors USA. It seems to deliver on both our expectations for quality and thoughtful cuisine. For our next meal, I'm particularly interested in revisiting some of the dishes that have stood out in the past, like the Zesty Black Bean Burger for its bold flavors and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp for the delightful taste.

However, I'm also tempted to try something new, perhaps the Harvest Veggie Stack, which sounds like it would offer the artistic presentation and Mediterranean-inspired flavors I enjoy. Plus, its gluten-free nature fits my dietary requirements.

Before we make a final decision, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the dishes you'd be interested in trying for our upcoming meal. Shall we consider including a mix of our previous favorites and maybe one or two new selections to keep our dining experience exciting and varied?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I'm completely with you on mixing our previous favorites with something new. I would love to revisit the Zesty Black Bean Burger, as it's been consistently impressive. The Cobb Salad is another dish I've been meaning to try, given its healthy profile and the fact that it's a classic with a twist—just the kind of sandwich alternative I enjoy.

As for trying something new, the Grilled Portobello Burger caught my attention. It's a sandwich variant that's healthy and seems to be packed with flavor, which is right up my alley. And I think the Harvest Veggie Stack you mentioned would be an excellent addition to our table, providing that new experience we're looking for without straying from the health-conscious theme we both appreciate.

I think this selection strikes a good balance between reliability and novelty. What do you think? If we're in agreement, we could finalize these dishes in the next round of our discussion.

[Olivia->all]: Hello everyone, based on our previous experiences and my own preferences, I'm inclined to suggest we dine at American Flavors USA again. My gluten allergy is well-accommodated there, and the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp have been consistently delicious. The Sunset Berry Cheesecake is also a lovely gluten-free dessert option. Given my Mediterranean taste preference, I find their use of spices and fresh ingredients quite satisfying. Plus, the service has always been top-notch. What do you all think?

[Charlie->all]: Hi Olivia and everyone, I appreciate your suggestion. I've noticed that American Flavors USA has indeed been a great choice for us in the past, especially considering the health-conscious and flavorful options like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Cobb Salad, which align perfectly with my preferences for sandwiches and salads. However, since we have been frequenting American Flavors USA quite a bit, I'm wondering if perhaps we should give Classic American Bistro another try for a change of scenery. Their Autumn Chicken & Pomegranate Salad and the Garden Harvest Veggie Burger with Sweet Potato Fries could be good options for me. But, to be fair, I am a bit picky, and the consistency at American Flavors USA is tempting. Let's hear everyone's thoughts and see if there's a consensus or if we should explore the Classic American Bistro menu a bit more for variety. What does everyone else think?

[Olivia->all]: I understand where you're coming from, Charlie. It's nice to switch things up occasionally. However, considering my dietary restrictions and the fact that we've consistently had a positive experience at American Flavors USA, I'm a bit hesitant to risk trying somewhere else that may not meet my gluten-free needs as effectively. Also, the artistic side of me really enjoys the presentation and creativity of the dishes at American Flavors USA. But I'm open to hearing more about Classic American Bistro's offerings, especially if they have any new dishes that align with my dietary restrictions and preferences. Shall we compare the menus a bit more closely, or does anyone have a strong opinion about trying Classic American Bistro again?

[Charlie->all]: I hear both your points, Olivia and Charlie. While American Flavors USA has been a reliable choice that caters well to our health-conscious diets and offers consistent quality, I do agree with Charlie that variety is the spice of life. Classic American Bistro's menu has some appealing options that fit my taste, like the Autumn Chicken & Pomegranate Salad, and I'm curious to see if their service and quality have improved.

However, I'm quite selective about where I eat, and I lean towards establishments that can provide a consistently good dining experience. American Flavors USA has proven to be such a place for us, especially with dishes like the Cobb Salad and the Zesty Black Bean Burger that I particularly enjoy. 

So my inclination is to stick with what we know is good, but I'm open to considering Classic American Bistro if they have enticing new offerings that can guarantee a comparable experience. Let's take another look at both menus and see if there's anything that particularly stands out at Classic American Bistro, which might sway us to give it another chance. Otherwise, I'd be happy to return to American Flavors USA. What do the rest of you think? Shall we dive into the menus once more, or are we ready to make a decision?

[Olivia->all]: I appreciate the thoughtful considerations from both of you. It's true that we've been enjoying American Flavors USA quite a bit, and their dishes have consistently met our needs and expectations. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp are personal favorites of mine and have been a hit every time. Moreover, being gluten-free, I find comfort in knowing that American Flavors USA has options that cater to my dietary restrictions without compromising on taste.

On the other hand, Classic American Bistro does seem to have some interesting items, such as the Autumn Chicken & Pomegranate Salad, which could potentially satisfy our taste for something different. However, my main concern is whether they can accommodate my gluten-free needs as well as American Flavors USA does.

I'm leaning towards returning to American Flavors USA for the assurance of quality and service that align with my health needs and artistic appreciation for food. Yet, I'm open to considering Classic American Bistro if they have introduced new gluten-free options that are on par with what we've experienced at American Flavors USA. Perhaps we should take one final look at the menus to ensure we're making the best choice for everyone's preferences and dietary requirements. Shall we do that, or are we ready to decide based on our previous experiences?

[Charlie->all]: Thank you, Olivia, for sharing your thoughts. After considering both options, my priority is to have a meal that is both healthy and caters to my preferences for sandwiches and salads. While I'm tempted by the variety and potential new experiences at Classic American Bistro, I must admit that American Flavors USA has consistently provided us with delicious and healthy dishes that align perfectly with my tastes. The Cobb Salad and the Zesty Black Bean Burger have been particular favorites of mine, and I know that the restaurant caters well to our varied dietary needs without any issues.

I'm a bit picky, and knowing that American Flavors USA offers a reliable and satisfying meal every time is quite important to me. While I'm open to change, the consistent quality and service at American Flavors USA seem to be the safer choice for a guaranteed good dining experience. Unless there is a strong case for Classic American Bistro that I'm overlooking, my vote would be to stick with American Flavors USA for another enjoyable meal.

I'm ready to make a decision, but I'd like to make sure we're all on the same page. So, if there's no further input that might sway the decision towards Classic American Bistro, I propose we choose American Flavors USA for our meal today. What do you all think? Are we ready to move forward with this choice, or does anyone have any additional points to discuss?

[Olivia->all]: Given my affinity for Mediterranean cuisine, I would naturally gravitate towards dishes with similar flavor profiles - fresh, herby, and often featuring seafood or well-seasoned vegetables. In light of my gluten-free dietary restriction, I appreciate that American Flavors USA has a track record of providing gluten-free options, such as the Zesty Black Bean Burger on a gluten-free bun, and the Sunset Berry Cheesecake with a gluten-free crust.

My allergies necessitate a careful selection of dishes, and it seems American Flavors USA has been consistently mindful of health concerns. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp has been a standout dish for me in the past and aligns with my Mediterranean taste preferences. Additionally, my artistic personality draws me to meals that are not only flavorful but also well-presented.

Considering all of this, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA for our next dining experience. I'm open to hearing other opinions before making a final decision. Charlie, what are your thoughts?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I appreciate your considerations and your leanings towards American Flavors USA based on your gluten-free needs and Mediterranean flavor preferences. I must say, my experiences at American Flavors USA have been quite positive overall, especially with their health-conscious options which suit my healthy lifestyle. Their Zesty Black Bean Burger has been a particular favorite of mine, and I've always found their salads, like the Cobb Salad, to be fresh and satisfying.

Given my picky nature, I look for consistency and quality in my meals, and it seems American Flavors USA has demonstrated this across our previous visits. However, I'm also intrigued by the revamped menu at Classic American Bistro, especially the Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken which seems in line with my preference for healthier options like salads and sandwiches.

While I have no dietary restrictions to consider, I do prioritize delicious food and superior service. Based on our previous scores and comments, American Flavors USA seems to have a slight edge in these areas. Still, I'm open to exploring our options and would like to hear more thoughts before settling on a final decision. Shall we consider the recent changes at Classic American Bistro, or stick with the reliability of American Flavors USA?

[Olivia->all]: Charlie, I see your point about the appeal of trying something new at Classic American Bistro. Their Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken does sound tempting and could potentially satisfy my Mediterranean taste buds with its herby profile. However, considering my allergies and the need for gluten-free options, American Flavors USA has proven to be a consistently safe and satisfying choice. They have demonstrated their ability to cater to my dietary restrictions without compromising on flavor.

While I'm not against trying new places and dishes, I believe it's important to prioritize our health and dietary needs. Moreover, the customer scores and our individual experiences suggest that American Flavors USA has a better track record in terms of both delicious food and superior service.

If we were to dine at American Flavors USA once more, I would be interested in revisiting the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and the Zesty Black Bean Burger, which have been consistently enjoyable. Of course, I'd be happy to consider any other dishes that you might be interested in, especially if they align with our mutual preference for healthy and flavorful meals. Let's come to a consensus on this before we make our final decision.

[Charlie->all]: I hear both of your points, Olivia and Charlie. Olivia, your need for gluten-free options is quite important, and I've noticed that American Flavors USA does offer a solid range of dishes that cater to your dietary restrictions. And Charlie, your emphasis on healthy eating and superior service is well-taken. The consistent quality of the meals and service at American Flavors USA has been notable in our past experiences.

I'm inclined to lean towards American Flavors USA as well. Their menu seems to have a balance of the sandwiches and salads I enjoy, with an emphasis on health which is crucial for me. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and Cobb Salad have been personal favorites, and I'm also curious about the Harvest Veggie Stack for its healthful approach to vegetables, which might be a fresh addition to our usual choices.

Classic American Bistro does have enticing options, like the Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken, but I'm a bit hesitant due to the lack of familiarity and the slightly lower customer score. I value consistency in my meals, particularly when it comes to health and taste.

Before we finalize our decision, are there any other considerations we should take into account, or are we leaning towards making our next dining experience at American Flavors USA with a focus on the dishes we've discussed?

[Olivia->all]: The Zesty Black Bean Burger had a nice texture, although it was slightly less flavorful than I hoped, missing that robust punch I've enjoyed in the past. I'd rate it as fair, around a 6.8. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, while good, didn't quite hit the mark of excellence that I remember, I'd give it a 7.1. The Cobb Salad was fresh but lacked a bit of the zest from the dressing, so a 6.6 seems fair. Harvest Veggie Stack was decent, well-seasoned, and I'd rate it a 6.8. Lastly, the Sunset Berry Cheesecake was satisfying but not remarkable, earning a 6.4 from me. Overall, the meal was good but didn't quite live up to the outstanding experiences we've had previously.

Overall, a fairly good meal but not as impressive as past visits.

[Olivia->all]: Reflecting on our meal, the dishes at American Flavors USA were generally good, but they didn't quite reach the high expectations set by previous visits. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was satisfactory, but it lacked the depth of flavor I anticipated, so I'd rate it a 6.8. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, although the best of the bunch, still didn't dazzle as it used to, meriting a 7.1. The Cobb Salad, while fresh, didn't have that punchy dressing I enjoyed last time, making it a 6.6 for me. The Harvest Veggie Stack was quite enjoyable with its well-seasoned layers, scoring a 6.8. Lastly, the Sunset Berry Cheesecake fell short of its usual standard, especially in flavor, so I'd give it a 6.4. It was a pleasant meal overall, but there's certainly room for improvement to reach the excellence we know they're capable of.

[Charlie->all]: The dishes today at American Flavors USA were generally satisfactory, but not as exceptional as I'd hoped for. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was fair, lacking some of the bold flavors I enjoy, so I'd rate it a 6.8. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, while being the highlight, still didn't quite meet the outstanding ratings I've come to expect, earning a 7.1 from me. The Cobb Salad was fresh but could have used a more vibrant dressing; it gets a 6.6. The Harvest Veggie Stack was good, deserving a 6.8 for its flavorful vegetables. The Sunset Berry Cheesecake was the least impressive, not quite hitting the mark on taste or texture, so I'll give it a 6.4. Overall, the meal was good, but not to the standard I've experienced at American Flavors USA in the past. There's certainly room for them to step up their game to their usual level of excellence.

[Olivia->all]: Reflecting on the meal at American Flavors USA, I would say it was a fairly good experience, though it didn't quite live up to the exceptional standards we've encountered before. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was fair; it had a good texture but lacked a bit of flavor, so I'd give it a 6.8. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was the standout dish for me, offering a good, savory taste, and I'd rate it a 7.1. The Cobb Salad was fresh, yet it could have been enhanced with a zestier dressing, earning a 6.6. The Harvest Veggie Stack was enjoyable, with a nice seasoning that complimented the vegetables, so it gets a 6.8. Lastly, the Sunset Berry Cheesecake was a bit underwhelming in terms of the richness I expected, so I'll rate it a 6.4. Overall, the dining experience was good, but there's a notable difference when compared to the outstanding visits we've had in the past. I look forward to them elevating their dishes back to the previous high standard.

[Charlie->all]: Reflecting on our meal at American Flavors USA, I found the offerings to be good on the whole, but not as memorable as they have been on previous occasions. The Zesty Black Bean Burger, which I rated at a 6.8, had a pleasant texture but didn't deliver the flavor intensity that I expected. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was the most fulfilling dish of the evening, and I'd rate it a 7.1 for its well-balanced flavors. The Cobb Salad, scoring a 6.6, was fresh but needed more zest in the dressing to really shine. The Harvest Veggie Stack was satisfying with its variety of seasoned vegetables, meriting a 6.8. Lastly, the Sunset Berry Cheesecake was somewhat disappointing in both texture and taste, so it receives a 6.4 from me. All in all, the meal was fairly good, but not quite up to the high standards that American Flavors USA has set in the past. I'm hopeful that they will return to their previously outstanding level of culinary excellence in the future.

[Olivia->all]: Given my preferences for Mediterranean cuisine, my gluten-free dietary restriction, and the focus on delicious, health-conscious options, I would like to discuss the potential choices between American Flavors USA and Classic American Bistro. While American Flavors USA has consistently offered dishes that cater to my gluten-free needs, the recent experiences suggest that the quality may be slightly declining. On the other hand, Classic American Bistro seems to have received some positive feedback recently, although I am not sure how well they can accommodate my gluten-free requirement.

From American Flavors USA, I am intrigued by the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, which have been highlights in the past. From Classic American Bistro, the Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken could be a good fit for my Mediterranean taste, assuming they can ensure it's gluten-free.

I would like to hear from Charlie and the others to understand their preferences and dietary needs better before we make a final decision. Charlie, what are your thoughts on the options, and how important are health-conscious choices for you in this meal?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I appreciate your consideration of health-conscious choices. I am quite picky and have a preference for sandwiches and salads, with an emphasis on healthy options. Looking at both menus, American Flavors USA seems to have a history of delivering dishes that align with my taste and health preferences, especially with options like the Cobb Salad Deluxe and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl. However, I've noticed that our recent experiences there have been less extraordinary, which is a bit concerning for my picky nature.

On the other hand, Classic American Bistro seems to have upped their game lately, and their menu does feature some appealing options like the American Innovator Burger and the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait. While these may not be the healthiest choices, perhaps they can offer a salad or a lighter dish that would meet my preferences.

I'm open to trying Classic American Bistro, considering our recent experiences at American Flavors USA have been less consistent. But I'm curious about how well they can cater to not just my health preferences but also to your gluten-free needs, Olivia. It might be worth inquiring if they offer gluten-free versions of their dishes. What do you think? Shall we take a chance on Classic American Bistro or stick with the familiar at American Flavors USA?

[Olivia->all]: Charlie, I'm glad to hear your thoughts, and I share your concern about the consistency at American Flavors USA. Given our recent experiences there, it might be refreshing to switch things up and give Classic American Bistro a chance. I'm drawn to their Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken, which seems like it could align well with my Mediterranean taste preference. However, the key factor for me will be ensuring that they can provide a gluten-free option. 

I agree that we should inquire about the possibility of gluten-free dishes at Classic American Bistro, especially since my allergy cannot be taken lightly. If they can accommodate my dietary restrictions, I'm inclined to try their offerings. After all, a change could be a delightful surprise for our taste buds.

Before we make a final decision, I think we should also consider the opinions of the other members of our group. Their preferences and dietary needs are just as important, and it's essential that everyone enjoys the meal. 

Let's circle back after hearing from the others and then, if we're all in agreement, we can consider trying out Classic American Bistro for our next meal. What does everyone else think?

[Charlie->all]: I've been following the discussion, and while I am quite picky with my food choices, I'm leaning towards trying something new at Classic American Bistro. The American Innovator Burger does sound tempting, and if they offer a salad option, it could suit my preference for sandwiches and salads. Plus, the possibility of a lighter dish that is health-conscious is appealing to me.

Olivia, I understand your concerns about gluten-free options. It's crucial that Classic American Bistro can accommodate your dietary needs. If they can ensure a gluten-free meal for you, I am willing to give them a chance, as it might be nice to have a different dining experience.

It's important that everyone else in our group is comfortable with this potential change, especially considering the dietary restrictions and preferences. Let's see if Classic American Bistro can cater to our needs, and if so, I think it's worth exploring their menu for our next outing. Shall we inquire about their ability to provide gluten-free dishes and see if they have any healthier, lighter options for me as well? After we gather this information, we can come to a final decision. What does everyone else think?

[Olivia->all]: I'm glad to hear your openness to trying Classic American Bistro, Charlie. It's important that we all have a meal that satisfies our taste preferences and dietary requirements. I'm curious and hopeful that Classic American Bistro can provide a satisfying gluten-free option for me, and I'm equally interested in ensuring that there are healthy choices available for you as well.

If the rest of our group is on board, I suggest we contact Classic American Bistro to inquire about their ability to accommodate a gluten-free diet and if they have any salad or lighter options that would appeal to Charlie's health-conscious preferences. Depending on their response, we can then decide whether to dine there or revert to American Flavors USA, where we know my gluten-free needs can be met.

Let's gather everyone's input and see if we are all in agreement to reach out to Classic American Bistro. We can then take the next step based on the information we receive. What do the rest of you think?

[Charlie->all]: I'm in agreement with both Olivia and Charlie on reaching out to Classic American Bistro to see if they can provide suitable options for us. Since we're looking for something new while still ensuring our dietary preferences and restrictions are met, it seems like a fair approach to inquire about their gluten-free accommodations and healthier dish selections.

If Classic American Bistro can meet our needs, I'm all for giving them a try. A new experience could be quite enjoyable, and their recent positive feedback is encouraging. Let's find out if they can cater to a gluten-free diet for Olivia and if there's a lighter, health-conscious option that would be perfect for me.

Should we proceed with contacting Classic American Bistro to get more information about their menu options? If they can't accommodate us, we can always return to American Flavors USA, where we know what to expect. What's the consensus from the rest of the group?

It seems like the restaurant managed to provide both healthy and indulgent options, catering to our diverse preferences effectively. Overall, a very good dining experience.

[Olivia->all]: Given my preferences for Mediterranean cuisine, my gluten-free dietary restriction, and my artistic personality, I'd like to propose exploring the menu at Classic American Bistro today. They've introduced a new dish, the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature, that sounds like a creative and flavorful option. Although it doesn't directly cater to Mediterranean flavors, the use of spices such as the coffee rub and the bourbon-mushroom sauce might offer a culinary experience that aligns with my artistic appreciation for complex and layered flavors.

I also noticed they have a dish called Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken, which could potentially align with my taste preferences due to the use of herbs and citrus glaze. It's important to check if these dishes can be tailored to accommodate a gluten-free diet, as my allergies are a significant consideration.

American Flavors USA has been a consistent choice for us, but given the slight dip in their recent scores and my interest in trying something new to satisfy my artistic inclinations, I'm leaning towards giving Classic American Bistro another visit. Their diverse menu and the introduction of the new signature dish by Chef Ramsey seem promising.

I'd like to hear the group's thoughts on this and see if anyone else is interested in trying something new or if there are any other dietary considerations we should take into account. Charlie, what do you think? Would you be up for trying the new prime ribeye at Classic American Bistro, or do you have a different preference today?

[Charlie->all]: I appreciate the suggestion, Olivia. I do have a penchant for sandwiches and salads, and I value a healthy eating style. However, I am also very picky about my food choices. Looking at Classic American Bistro's menu, I'm intrigued by the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe, which could satisfy my sandwich preference, and the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait, which seems like a refreshing and light option. However, I'd have to ensure that these choices align with my health-conscious approach.

On the other hand, American Flavors USA offers the Cobb Salad Deluxe and the Spicy Black Bean Burger, which have been consistent hits for me in the past. It's true that their recent scores have dipped slightly, but they still offer a range of options that cater to my tastes and health requirements.

Given that we've visited American Flavors USA quite frequently, I'm open to the idea of changing things up and trying the new dishes at Classic American Bistro, particularly if they can offer a healthy twist to their menu items. I'm also interested in hearing from the rest of the group to see if they have any preferences or dietary needs that we should consider before making our final decision. What are everyone else's thoughts on today's dining choice?

[Olivia->all]: I'm glad to hear that you're open to trying Classic American Bistro, Charlie. I understand your health-conscious approach and your preferences for salads and sandwiches. It's important that we find a balance between satisfying our taste buds and adhering to our dietary restrictions and health goals.

While I am drawn to the new offerings at Classic American Bistro, especially the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature, which seems to be an artistic creation from Chef Ramsey, I do want to make sure that my gluten-free requirement is met. I will inquire about adapting the dishes to be gluten-free if we decide to go there.

I'd also like to mention that the diversity of their menu seems to offer something for everyone, and it would be a nice change from our recent visits to American Flavors USA. It's essential to have variety in our dining experiences to keep them exciting and enjoyable.

Let's see what the rest of the group has to say. It's important that we all agree on a place that caters to our various tastes and dietary needs. How does everyone feel about giving Classic American Bistro a try today or do you have any other preferences?

[Charlie->all]: I'm inclined to try out Classic American Bistro today. Their Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe could be a great sandwich option for me, and the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait aligns with my preference for salads—assuming it's a lighter, salad-like dessert. Plus, I'm always on the lookout for meals that fit a healthy lifestyle.

I've noticed that we've been frequenting American Flavors USA quite often, and their Cobb Salad Deluxe and Spicy Black Bean Burger have consistently pleased my palate. Yet, the idea of switching things up is appealing, especially since Classic American Bistro has a new chef and dish that might offer a fresh culinary experience.

Olivia's point about ensuring the dishes are gluten-free is well-taken, and since I don't have such dietary restrictions, I'm flexible on that front. I'm curious to see if Classic American Bistro can offer a satisfying experience both in terms of taste and healthiness. If they can cater to our health-conscious approach without compromising on flavor, I'm all for giving it a shot.

Let's gather everyone's opinions and see if we can reach a consensus on where to dine today. If we decide on Classic American Bistro, I'm eager to try the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe, and maybe we can include the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait as a shared dessert for its healthful approach. What do the rest of you think?

[Olivia->all]: It seems we are both intrigued by the menu at Classic American Bistro, and I think it's worth exploring. The Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature could be an exciting dish to try, and I'll ensure to ask about preparing it in a gluten-free manner. Charlie, your choices of the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe and the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait sound delightful, and I'm sure they will have options that fit your healthy lifestyle.

Before we make a final decision, I'd like to hear from the rest of the group on their preferences. It's essential that we choose a restaurant that caters to all of our needs and that everyone enjoys their meal. If there are no strong objections or other dietary restrictions we need to consider, I think Classic American Bistro could be a great choice for today's dining experience. What do others in the group think? Are there any other preferences or dietary needs we should consider before we make our final decision?

[Charlie->all]: I'm leaning towards trying Classic American Bistro as well. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe definitely catches my attention for a hearty sandwich, and the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait would be a pleasant, lighter finish to the meal. I'm interested in how the bistro has evolved with their new chef's creations, and the introduction of the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature has piqued my curiosity, even though I typically prefer sandwiches and salads.

I value a healthy lifestyle, so I'd like to inquire about the nutritional content and preparation methods of the dishes at Classic American Bistro to ensure they align with my health-conscious approach. If they can accommodate these preferences without compromising taste, I'm all for giving them a try.

Since we've been to American Flavors USA multiple times recently, it might be refreshing to change our routine. However, I want to make sure that everyone in our group is happy with the choice. If there are no significant dietary concerns or other preferences that we haven't yet considered, I'm ready to support a visit to Classic American Bistro today. Shall we proceed with finalizing our decision? What do you all think?

[Olivia->all]: Hey everyone, given my love for Mediterranean flavors, I'm leaning towards dishes that offer fresh, herby, and citrus profiles. Since I need gluten-free options and have allergies to consider, I find Classic American Bistro's Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken seems like it could be a good fit for me. It has that citrus element I enjoy, and it's a healthier choice. The last time we visited Classic American Bistro, I was quite satisfied with their offerings. What do you all think?

[Charlie]: I agree that Classic American Bistro has been consistently good, and they offer a diverse menu that seems to cater well to our dietary restrictions and health preferences. However, I've really enjoyed the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp at American Flavors USA. They've been quite attentive to our health-conscious needs as well. It's a tough choice today!

[Olivia]: Charlie, I totally get your point about the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp - it's been a hit for us. I'm just concerned about finding enough variety at American Flavors USA that aligns with my preference for Mediterranean-inspired dishes. Do you think we could find a happy medium there?

[Charlie]: I see your point, Olivia. Perhaps we could consider the menu options again and see if American Flavors USA has dishes that could satisfy your Mediterranean palate. Otherwise, I'm open to going back to Classic American Bistro, as they've been reliable and delicious in the past.

[Olivia]: Thanks, Charlie! Let's take another look at the menus and make a decision that pleases everyone's tastes and needs.

[Charlie->all]: Given the discussion, I'm noticing that both restaurants have their merits. Classic American Bistro offers dishes like the Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken which would cater to Olivia's preferences, and their overall score and comments reflect a positive experience from the group.

On the other hand, American Flavors USA seems to have a standout dish with the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp that I've enjoyed before, and their menu also includes healthy options like the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and the Harvest Veggie Stack Fire-Roasted Edition that I find appealing for my health-conscious diet. Plus, their overall customer score is slightly higher than Classic American Bistro's.

I'm thinking we should consider if American Flavors USA has enough variety to accommodate both my pickiness and Olivia's Mediterranean flavor preference. If we feel that it does, it might be the right choice for today. Otherwise, we might fall back on the tried and true Classic American Bistro which has served us well in the past. What do you think, Olivia? Shall we give American Flavors USA another look or stick with Classic American Bistro?

[Olivia->all]: Charlie, after revisiting both menus, I think we can indeed find a balance at American Flavors USA. Their Zesty Chimichurri Tofu Platter offers that herby flavor profile I enjoy, and it's gluten-free which works for my dietary restrictions. Plus, the Harvest Veggie Stack Fire-Roasted Edition might have that Mediterranean flair I'm seeking with the fire-roasted peppers and sun-dried tomato pesto. It seems like American Flavors USA has broadened their menu to include more diverse flavors, which I appreciate. Given this and the higher customer score, I'm willing to give American Flavors USA a try today if you're on board with it. Shall we go for it?

The Zesty Chimichurri Tofu Platter was a delightful surprise with its herby sauce, and the Harvest Veggie Stack Fire-Roasted Edition had a lovely Mediterranean twist that I thoroughly enjoyed. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was fresh and satisfying as well. I'd give an 8 for the shrimp and a 7.5 for the other dishes.

The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp maintained its high standard, and I found the Harvest Veggie Stack Fire-Roasted Edition to be particularly impressive with its rich flavors.

I'd rate the shrimp at 8.5 and the other dishes at 7.5 each.

[Charlie->all]: I must say, the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was as delightful as always, and it's definitely a dish I would recommend.

I'd score the shrimp an 8, and the other dishes a solid 7 each.

[Olivia->all]: The meal overall was quite satisfying. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp had a lovely balance of flavors, and the Zesty Chimichurri Tofu Platter was a highlight with its vibrant sauce. The Harvest Veggie Stack Fire-Roasted Edition brought some of the Mediterranean essence I love, and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was refreshing. My scores are 8 for the shrimp and 7.5 for the rest of the dishes.

[Charlie->all]: The dishes at American Flavors USA were all quite enjoyable. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp lived up to its reputation with a rich flavor that I appreciated. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was a healthy choice that didn't compromise on taste. The Zesty Chimichurri Tofu Platter was a pleasant surprise, offering a nice herby kick that I found quite satisfying. Lastly, the Harvest Veggie Stack Fire-Roasted Edition was a good attempt at Mediterranean flavors, though perhaps not as robust as I would have preferred. I would give the shrimp an 8, the tofu platter and quinoa bowl 7.5 each, and the veggie stack a 7.

[Olivia->all]: Looking back at our meal, I think American Flavors USA did a great job in meeting our expectations. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was outstanding with its perfect 8 score. The Zesty Chimichurri Tofu Platter was quite good; it had a nice zest to it and scored a 7.5 from me. The Harvest Veggie Stack Fire-Roasted Edition was another favorite with its Mediterranean flavors, earning a 7.5. Lastly, the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl, while healthy and satisfying, didn't wow me as much, so it gets a 7. Overall, a very good dining experience!
