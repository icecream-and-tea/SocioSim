[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[William->all]: Given my personal preferences for sushi and Japanese cuisine, I find that neither Classic American Bistro nor American Flavors USA aligns perfectly with my taste. However, I am open to trying other types of food as long as the quality and service are commendable. 

Reviewing both menus, I notice that Classic American Bistro offers a Grilled Salmon dish, which is the closest option to my preferred cuisine, as it is a common fish served in Japanese cooking. Furthermore, the price points at Classic American Bistro seem slightly higher, which I interpret as possibly indicating a higher quality of ingredients or a more refined culinary approach. 

Without customer scores or comments to guide the decision, I must rely on the menu descriptions and my own budget. I am healthy with no dietary restrictions and am reserved by nature, so a quiet and quality meal is more appealing to me than a potentially busier and noisier setting.

Given these considerations, I lean towards choosing Classic American Bistro for this meal. I would be interested in hearing the opinions of others before making a final decision.

[Felix->all]: As much as I appreciate the culinary diversity and the classic charm of American cuisine, my personal preference leans towards Chinese flavors. However, since that option isn't available, I'm willing to explore other cuisines and make a choice that aligns with my analytical nature.

Upon studying both menus, I do not find a direct match with Chinese cuisine; however, both restaurants offer dishes with elements that are indirectly reminiscent of Chinese flavors, such as the BBQ Ribs at both restaurants which could be similar to Chinese barbecued meats in terms of the savory and sweet glaze.

Between Classic American Bistro and American Flavors USA, the Classic American Bistro's menu seems to present a more sophisticated selection with slightly higher prices, which might suggest better quality or a unique dining experience. Since I have no dietary restrictions and I am in good health, I can choose freely from the menu.

While William has expressed a preference towards the Grilled Salmon at Classic American Bistro, I am intrigued by the Smokey BBQ Ribs and the New York Cheesecake from the same restaurant. The detailed descriptions and the promise of high-quality ingredients in the advertisement are appealing to my analytical side.

Considering the shared information and William's inclination, I am also leaning towards Classic American Bistro. It would be interesting to further discuss and hear from others to come to a consensus.

[Xavier->all]: As someone with a vibrant personality and a love for Caribbean cuisine, I'm always on the lookout for bold flavors and a lively dining atmosphere. Neither Classic American Bistro nor American Flavors USA specializes in Caribbean flavors, but that doesn't mean I can't find something enjoyable at these establishments.

Looking at the menus, I'm drawn to dishes that might offer the rich and hearty experience I typically enjoy. The Smokey BBQ Ribs at Classic American Bistro immediately catch my eye, as BBQ is often rich in flavors, which might somewhat satisfy my craving for the kind of robust, spiced food I love. Additionally, their New York Cheesecake could be a sweet end to the meal.

On the other hand, American Flavors USA offers a BBQ Ribs dish at a more affordable price, which is appealing given my middle-class income. Their Pulled Pork Sandwich also sounds flavorful and satisfying. The dessert options like the Apple Pie a la Mode offer a classic American taste that could be a delightful experience.

Both William and Felix have shown a preference for Classic American Bistro, and while the higher price points are a consideration for my budget, I agree that the menu descriptions and the advertisement's emphasis on quality are promising. Therefore, I'm inclined towards Classic American Bistro as well, primarily because of the Smokey BBQ Ribs and the potential for a lively ambiance that suits my personality.

Before we finalize our decision, I'm curious to know if there are any other factors we should consider, such as the service quality or the dining environment, which are also important to me. Shall we discuss these aspects before we make our final choice?

[Paula->all]: As someone who enjoys Greek food, neither Classic American Bistro nor American Flavors USA directly aligns with my culinary preferences. However, I am always open to new dining experiences and enjoy the company of others in a lively setting, given my outgoing personality.

From the menu at Classic American Bistro, the Grilled Salmon stands out to me as a dish that might carry some Mediterranean influences, which could be a nod to my preference for Greek cuisine. The detailed descriptions and the advertisement’s focus on fresh and high-quality ingredients are quite enticing. Additionally, the menu seems to offer a variety of dishes that could cater to different tastes within our group.

American Flavors USA also offers an inviting menu with slightly lower prices, which is great for my middle-class income. Their BBQ Ribs and Pulled Pork Sandwich could provide the comforting and hearty meal that I sometimes crave. The Apple Pie a la Mode is a classic dessert that would likely be a pleasurable finish to the meal.

Considering the input from William, Felix, and Xavier, it seems that there is a collective lean towards Classic American Bistro. The quality suggested by their menu prices and the appeal of their dishes, such as the Smokey BBQ Ribs and the New York Cheesecake, resonate with me as well. 

Regarding service and dining environment, I would expect Classic American Bistro to offer a more refined experience given the higher price points and the sophisticated menu presentation. This aligns with my preference for a place with not only good food but also an enjoyable atmosphere.

Therefore, I am also in favor of choosing Classic American Bistro for our dining experience. If everyone is in agreement, we could consider this as our preliminary decision and move forward to the final round of discussion for confirmation and dish selection.

[William->all]: It appears that we all have varying culinary preferences, yet we've collectively shown a preference for Classic American Bistro, making it the current frontrunner. The restaurant's emphasis on high-quality ingredients and the more sophisticated menu options seem to align well with our group's diverse tastes and the desire for a pleasant dining experience.

Classic American Bistro's Grilled Salmon is an appealing choice for me, given my fondness for sushi and Japanese cuisine, and it seems to resonate with Paula's preference for Mediterranean influences. Felix's analytical approach has also led him to appreciate the detailed descriptions of dishes like the Smokey BBQ Ribs and New York Cheesecake. Xavier's attraction to rich and hearty flavors is met with the same Smokey BBQ Ribs, which might offer the boldness he seeks, reminiscent of Caribbean cuisine.

The service quality and dining environment have not been explicitly discussed, but the general assumption based on the menu and pricing suggests Classic American Bistro might provide a superior dining experience. This could potentially offer the quiet and quality atmosphere I prefer as a reserved individual.

Unless there are any objections or additional considerations from the group, I propose that we move towards confirming Classic American Bistro as our choice and selecting dishes that cater to each of our tastes and dietary needs. If everyone agrees, we can proceed to the final round to finalize our decision and place our order. Does anyone have any other thoughts or concerns before we move ahead?

[William->all]: The Grilled Salmon was fair but not quite what I was hoping for, considering my taste for sushi. It had a decent flavor, but I expected more given the description and price. My score for it would be a 6 out of 10. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were good; they had a nice balance of smokiness and tenderness, so I'd give them a 7. The New York Cheesecake was satisfactory but didn't stand out to me, so it's a 6. The Mac & Cheese and Caesar Salad were both fair, with the salad being a bit lackluster, so I'll rate them both 6. Overall, the meal was decent, but there seems to be room for improvement in flavor and execution.

[Felix->all]: The Grilled Salmon, while healthy, did not particularly resonate with my palate, which craves the complex flavors found in Chinese cuisine. I'd rate it a 6 as it was decent, but not exceptional. The Smokey BBQ Ribs, with their savory glaze, were the highlight, and I'd give them a 7 for coming closest to satisfying my taste. The New York Cheesecake was a solid 6; enjoyable but not extraordinary. The Mac & Cheese, with its creaminess, earns a 6 as it was comforting but could use more depth. The Caesar Salad was somewhat underwhelming in flavor, earning it a 5. The food was generally fair, but I anticipated a more robust taste experience based on the menu descriptions.

[Xavier->all]: The dishes at Classic American Bistro were quite satisfying overall. The Smokey BBQ Ribs stood out with a score of 7, as they had a rich flavor that I enjoyed, and they reminded me a bit of the boldness I love in Caribbean cuisine. The Grilled Salmon was decent with a score of 6. It was cooked well, but I hoped for a bit more flair. The New York Cheesecake and Mac & Cheese both get a 6; they were good but not particularly memorable. The Caesar Salad was the least impressive for me, lacking the zest I prefer in my salads, so it gets a 5. All in all, the meal was good, but I think there's potential for the dishes to reach the next level of flavor and presentation.

[Paula->all]: The meal at Classic American Bistro was quite the culinary journey, with a mix of hits and misses. The Grilled Salmon was average, earning a 6 from me, as it lacked the robust Mediterranean flavors I'm fond of in Greek cuisine. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were quite enjoyable, though, with a satisfying heartiness, so I'd give them a 7. The New York Cheesecake was good, but I expected a bit more indulgence, so it's a 6 for me. The Mac & Cheese was comforting, but not standout, and I'll rate it a 6. Lastly, the Caesar Salad was a fair attempt, but it didn't wow me, so it's a 5. The overall experience was pleasant, but I believe there's room for the bistro to enhance the flavors and dish presentations to truly make their mark.

[William->all]: Given my preference for Japanese cuisine and considering the offerings from Classic American Bistro and American Flavors USA, I think we should look for a restaurant with options that can cater to a diverse set of tastes. While neither restaurant specializes in sushi or Japanese food, it's important to select a place with dishes that are high in quality and flavor. Based on our previous experience, Classic American Bistro seems to have room for improvement in flavor, but they do seem to use fresh ingredients. The service was also commendable. American Flavors USA has a slightly lower customer score, and their comments also suggest a need for improvement in distinctiveness and creativity.

I propose we consider the overall dining experience including the potential for a diverse menu that could satisfy different palate preferences, as well as the quality of the dishes and service. Let's all share our thoughts and see if we can reach a consensus.

[Felix->all]: As someone with a penchant for Chinese cuisine, I look for bold flavors and a variety of spices in my meals. Neither restaurant specializes in Asian flavors, but there might be certain dishes with the complexity I crave. The Smokey BBQ Ribs at Classic American Bistro and the Smokin' Hot Brisket at American Flavors USA both sound like they could offer the rich, smoky flavors I enjoy.

I appreciate a well-analyzed decision, and based on the customer scores and comments, both restaurants have their strengths and weaknesses. The Classic American Bistro had commendable service and fresh ingredients but lacked in flavor. American Flavors USA, while having a slightly lower score, offers a menu that seems to have a bit more variety which might indicate a chance at finding those complex flavors I favor.

Considering our middle-class income, we should also be mindful of the prices to ensure we all can enjoy the meal without financial strain. Both restaurants seem to have a range of prices that could accommodate our budget.

My suggestion is that we look more closely at the specific dishes that could meet our varied tastes and dietary preferences, then weigh the options in terms of flavor, quality, and cost before making a final decision. Let's continue the discussion and take into account everyone's input.

[Xavier->all]: As a fan of Caribbean cuisine, I'm always on the lookout for vibrant flavors and dishes that remind me of home. Neither Classic American Bistro nor American Flavors USA specializes in Caribbean food, yet there are certain dishes on the menus that might come close to the hearty and rich tastes I'm drawn to.

From Classic American Bistro, the Smokey BBQ Ribs and the Signature Smokey Ribs could potentially satisfy my craving for smoky, well-seasoned meat. Additionally, the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon might offer a refreshing change with its herb flavors and citrus butter, which could be reminiscent of the zesty and aromatic dishes I enjoy.

On the other hand, American Flavors USA has the Smokin' Hot Brisket, which could also fulfill my preference for smoky flavors with a spicy edge. Moreover, the Zesty Black Bean Burger might be an interesting vegetarian option with its promise of zesty spices.

Considering the feedback from both restaurants, it seems that while both have room to improve in terms of flavor and creativity, they do offer dishes that could potentially cater to our diverse tastes. I agree with Felix that we should be mindful of our middle-class budget and look for options that offer great taste and value for money.

I am happy to hear more thoughts and narrow down our choices based on the flavor profiles that best match our individual preferences and the overall dining experience. Let's keep the conversation going and aim for a decision that satisfies all of us in terms of taste, service, and affordability.

[Paula->all]: As someone who loves Greek food, I'm always on the lookout for fresh ingredients and the bold, distinctive flavors that come with Mediterranean cuisine. While neither Classic American Bistro nor American Flavors USA is a Greek restaurant, there might still be dishes that align with my flavor preferences.

The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon from Classic American Bistro sounds like it could offer the type of flavors I enjoy, with the fresh herbs and citrus. However, from my previous experience, while the food was decent, it wasn't particularly noteworthy in terms of flavor. The customer score and comments seem to align with my experience, suggesting there's a need for improvement in the flavor department.

American Flavors USA also doesn't specifically cater to Greek tastes, but the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Cobb Salad with a zippy house dressing might provide the fresh and vibrant flavors I'm drawn to. They have a slightly lower customer score than Classic American Bistro, but they still offer a variety that could be promising.

Given our middle-class income, the prices at both places are reasonable and shouldn't be too much of a concern. In terms of service, Classic American Bistro had commendable service, which is important, but I'm also open to seeing if American Flavors USA can match that.

I think it's essential that we consider the potential for dishes to satisfy our individual tastes, the quality of the ingredients, and the overall dining experience. I'm looking forward to another round of discussion where we can perhaps narrow down our choices and then come to a decision that encompasses everyone's preferences and ensures an enjoyable meal for all of us. Let's continue our discussion and make a decision that we will all be happy with.

[William->all]: Reflecting on the input from Felix, Xavier, and Paula, it seems that we are all searching for a dining experience that offers both bold flavors and fresh ingredients. While neither restaurant perfectly aligns with our individual tastes for Asian, Caribbean, Greek, or Japanese cuisine, there are certain menu items from both establishments that have caught our interest.

From Classic American Bistro, the Smokey BBQ Ribs and the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon seem to be the most promising in terms of flavor. However, we've noted from previous experiences and customer comments that there's room for improvement in the flavor profile and presentation of their dishes. The commendable service is a plus, but we are primarily here for a memorable meal.

On the other hand, American Flavors USA offers the Smokin' Hot Brisket and the Zesty Black Bean Burger, which could potentially fulfill our desire for zest and variety. While their customer score is slightly lower, the comments point towards an average experience similar to that of the Classic American Bistro.

Considering our middle-class budget, both restaurants offer menu items within a range that is affordable for our group. It's crucial that the chosen dishes provide value for money in terms of taste and quality.

I propose that we take a closer look at the specific dishes that could cater to our diverse flavor preferences and make a decision based on the potential for an enjoyable and flavorful meal. Let's continue to deliberate and aim to reach a consensus on which restaurant and dishes will best meet our collective desires and expectations for this dining experience. Shall we proceed with a final round of discussion to finalize our choice?

[Felix->all]: Reviewing our discussions, it's evident that we are collectively leaning towards dishes with robust and complex flavors. At Classic American Bistro, the Smokey BBQ Ribs and the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon are recurring mentions, which I believe could somewhat satisfy my fondness for the bold flavors found in Chinese cuisine. However, we should bear in mind the feedback on the need for flavor enhancement at this establishment.

American Flavors USA, while slightly behind in customer score, showcases the Smokin' Hot Brisket and the Zesty Black Bean Burger, which could be closer to the smoky and spicy profiles I enjoy. The variety within their menu might also offer us a better chance at finding something that appeals to each of our unique tastes.

As we are all mindful of our middle-class income, it's reassuring that both restaurants cater to a range of budgets. Service quality is important, but I agree with the sentiment that our primary goal is to indulge in a meal that's both flavorful and memorable.

I suggest we take a more detailed look at the menus, perhaps focusing on the dishes that seem to resonate most with our group's diverse preferences. If we find that American Flavors USA offers a greater variety that could meet our tastes, it may be worth exploring despite the slightly lower score. On the other hand, if Classic American Bistro's commendable service and previous positive aspects weigh heavier, then it would also be a suitable choice.

I am ready for the next and final round of discussion where we can decide on the restaurant and the dishes to order, ensuring that we consider the taste, quality, and overall dining experience. Shall we move forward with our final deliberations and come to an agreement?

[Xavier->all]: Considering the points raised in our discussion, I'm inclined to suggest that we give American Flavors USA a chance this time around. While the customer score is slightly lower, the variety on the menu could potentially offer us the vibrant flavors we're looking for. The Smokin' Hot Brisket might satisfy my craving for smoky, spicy meat, and the Zesty Black Bean Burger could be an interesting dish with its promise of zesty spices, which may also appeal to Paula's preference for bold, distinctive flavors.

The prices at American Flavors USA are reasonable, which is important for our middle-class budget, and while service is an important aspect of dining, the food is our primary concern. Felix also pointed out that the variety might align more with his preference for complex flavors, and I think we should take the opportunity to explore this option.

Let us go for one more round of discussion to see if everyone agrees with trying out American Flavors USA and to choose the specific dishes we would want to order, ensuring that everyone's tastes and preferences are considered in the final decision. Shall we proceed?

[Paula->all]: It seems that we are all in agreement that we're looking for a meal with bold and distinct flavors, and while neither restaurant is a perfect match for our preferred cuisines, both offer options that could potentially satisfy our palates. Given our previous fair experience at Classic American Bistro and the room for improvement in flavor that has been noted, I'm leaning towards trying something new and giving American Flavors USA a chance. The menu items like the Smokin' Hot Brisket and the Zesty Black Bean Burger suggest a level of boldness and zest that could be reminiscent of the Greek flavors I love.

I'm also conscious of our middle-class budget, and both restaurants seem to offer dishes at prices that are within our range. The service at Classic American Bistro was good last time, but I'm willing to prioritize the food on this occasion. I believe that American Flavors USA might provide us with the variety and potential for those strong, vibrant flavors that we're all seeking.

I propose in the next round of discussion we start narrowing down our choices at American Flavors USA, looking at the dishes that could cater to our individual tastes, while also considering the overall group experience. If everyone agrees, then in the subsequent round, we can finalize our decision and select the dishes we will order from American Flavors USA. Shall we continue?

[William->all]: I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA again for tonight's dinner. My past experience there was quite positive, and the menu seems to have a few items that could satisfy our varied tastes. The Smokin' Hot Brisket was a standout last time, and I think we could explore more of their dishes. What does everyone else think?

[Felix->all]: I appreciate the appeal of American Flavors USA, William, especially since we had a good experience there previously. However, as someone who has a strong preference for Chinese cuisine, I noticed that neither of the restaurants specializes in that. Still, considering the options available, I'm inclined to explore dishes that might align closer with the flavors I enjoy, which tend to be bold and aromatic. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and the Southwest Spiced Steak at American Flavors USA seem to offer a taste profile that could potentially satisfy my palate. Let's hear from Xavier and Paula as well before we make a final decision.

[Xavier->all]: I'm glad we're revisiting our options, William and Felix. Given my vibrant personality and my love for Caribbean flavors, I'm inclined to side with American Flavors USA as well. The robust and hearty offerings like the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and the Southwest Spiced Steak seem like they'd offer the kind of bold flavors I usually enjoy. Also, my positive experience there last time further supports my leaning. While Classic American Bistro does have some healthier options, which I do consider important, their overall flavor profiles might not be as exciting as what American Flavors USA has to offer. Let's see what Paula has to say before we make our decision.

[Paula->all]: I'm glad we're revisiting our dining options together. I must say, I have a particular fondness for Greek food, which neither restaurant offers directly. However, given the descriptions and our previous experiences, I'm also inclined to lean towards American Flavors USA. The menu items like the Smokin' Hot Brisket and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken suggest a boldness in flavor that I think could be reminiscent of the hearty, well-seasoned dishes I enjoy in Greek cuisine. Plus, the customer scores and comments suggest we're more likely to enjoy our meal there. So, it sounds like we're all on the same page about giving American Flavors USA another visit tonight. Shall we move on to discussing what dishes to order?

[William->all]: It does seem like we've reached a consensus on American Flavors USA. Considering our previous positive experience and the appealing dishes that align with our diverse tastes, I think it's a good choice for tonight's meal. I'd like to propose that we include the Smokin' Hot Brisket and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken as part of our order, given their popularity among us. Perhaps we could also consider some of their other dishes that we haven't tried yet. What dishes would you all be interested in trying this time around?

[Felix->all]: I agree with the proposal to include the Smokin' Hot Brisket and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken in our order; both dishes seem to be hits and cater to my taste for bold flavors. Additionally, I think we should try the Southwest Spiced Steak, as it might have that aromatic punch I'm looking for, reminiscent of the spices used in Chinese cooking. For variety, the Zesty Black Bean Burger could be an interesting choice to round out our meal, providing a vegetarian option with a smoky twist. I'm also curious about the Cobb Salad, which might offer a lighter, zestier complement to our other selections. Shall we consider these options for our order, or are there other dishes anyone else is particularly keen to try?

[Xavier->all]: Given our previous dining experiences and the collective leanings towards American Flavors USA, I would like to propose that we officially choose American Flavors USA for our dinner tonight. We should definitely include the Smokin' Hot Brisket and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, as they have been mentioned favorably by multiple group members. I'd also like to suggest adding the Southwest Spiced Steak to our order, as it aligns with my preference for Caribbean-inspired flavors and seems to offer the kind of zest that Felix is looking for. The Zesty Black Bean Burger could be a great addition to provide some variety and satisfy any vegetarian preferences we might have. Finally, the Cobb Salad could be a refreshing side that complements the heavier main courses. Do we all agree on these selections, or does anyone have other preferences for dishes we should consider?

[Paula->all]: I think Xavier's proposal sounds great. American Flavors USA has a variety of dishes that seem to cater to our tastes, and the previous positive experience gives us confidence in returning there. The Smokin' Hot Brisket and Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken are definitely on my list, and I'm intrigued by the Southwest Spiced Steak, which sounds like it could offer some of the bold and aromatic flavors I enjoy in Greek cuisine. The Zesty Black Bean Burger adds a nice variety to our choices, catering to different dietary preferences, and the Cobb Salad seems like a fresh and zesty option to balance our meal. Unless anyone has any other dishes in mind, I would be happy to finalize this selection for our dinner tonight. Shall we proceed with these choices?

[William->all]: I must say, my preference leans towards sushi and Japanese cuisine, but given our options, I would like to suggest that we give Classic American Bistro another chance to see if they've improved since our last visit. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon sounds like it could be a healthier option, and perhaps the New York Cheesecake could be a delightful dessert. What do you all think?

[Felix->all]: I appreciate the idea of giving Classic American Bistro another chance; however, I must point out that I have a strong preference for Chinese cuisine. While neither restaurant specializes in that, American Flavors USA offers dishes with flavors that seem closer to the boldness I enjoy, such as the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken. Considering our previous experiences, American Flavors USA has consistently scored higher with an overall better impression on us. Moreover, our health-conscious group members might appreciate options like the Zesty Black Bean Burger. I'm inclined towards selecting American Flavors USA for our meal. What are your thoughts, Xavier and Paula?

[Xavier->all]: Felix, I'm with you on this one. My taste leans heavily towards Caribbean cuisine, and I feel that the bold flavors and spices offered at American Flavors USA, like the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers, would suit me well. Given that we are all healthy and without dietary restrictions, the variety and healthier options like the Zesty Black Bean Burger also appeal to me. Besides, our past experiences at American Flavors USA have been more satisfying overall, with both the food and service standing out. William, I do understand the idea of giving a place a second chance, but I think we should go with the option that has consistently delivered a better experience for us. Paula, what's your take on this?

[Paula->all]: Well, William and Felix, I absolutely adore Greek food, so I'm always on the lookout for bold flavors and a variety of spices in my meals. Given our previous experiences and scores, American Flavors USA seems to have a more consistent track record with an average higher score from us and more positive comments overall. I'm particularly drawn to dishes like the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers, which promise a burst of flavor that I tend to favor.

I also appreciate the fact that American Flavors USA seems to offer a variety of dishes that can cater to our health-conscious minds. The Zesty Black Bean Burger is a great vegetarian option that aligns with my taste for vibrant and diverse flavors. I think our previous experiences should weigh heavily on our decision, and it seems that American Flavors USA has been delivering on both taste and service.

So, my vote goes to American Flavors USA. I'm all about trying the dishes that have been well-received by others, and it sounds like we can all find something to enjoy there. Let's see if we can reach a consensus in the next round of our discussion. What do you all think? Shall we settle on American Flavors USA and discuss which dishes to order?

[William->all]: Given the feedback from Felix, Xavier, and Paula, I can see that American Flavors USA might be a better choice for our group. While my personal preference is for Japanese cuisine, it's clear that American Flavors USA has been providing us with more satisfying experiences overall. The dishes mentioned, like the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers, do sound appealing and flavorful, and I'm always open to trying new things.

The higher average score from our past visits and the positive comments about the variety and boldness of the flavors at American Flavors USA are convincing. I appreciate that there are healthier options available, such as the Zesty Black Bean Burger, which could be a good balance for our meal.

I agree with the group's leaning and I'm willing to give American Flavors USA another visit. Let's discuss which dishes we might want to order, keeping in mind our group's taste preferences and the desire for a variety of flavors and healthier options. Shall we start making a list of dishes to consider?

[Felix->all]: I'm glad to see we're all leaning towards American Flavors USA. Considering our past experiences and our group's taste for bold and diverse flavors, it seems like a solid choice. I'm particularly interested in trying the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken for its sweet and savory profile and the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers for a kick of spice.

I also think we should include the Zesty Black Bean Burger as a health-conscious option. It might be interesting for us to compare how the vegetarian fare stands up against the meat dishes in terms of flavor.

In terms of quantity, I believe we should order enough to allow everyone to try a bit of everything. Perhaps we can order multiple dishes and share them family-style? That way, we can all experience the variety American Flavors USA has to offer. Let's put together a tentative list of dishes to order, and we can finalize our decision in the next round. What does everyone else think?

[Xavier->all]: I'm with the group on this decision to head back to American Flavors USA. Our previous experiences have been positive, and the menu items seem to align well with my preference for Caribbean cuisine, which often features bold and zesty flavors. I'm particularly excited about the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers, as they promise a burst of flavors that I'm sure to enjoy.

I also agree with Felix's suggestion of ordering a variety of dishes to share. This way, we can taste more of what the restaurant has to offer and enjoy a communal dining experience, which suits my vibrant personality. The Zesty Black Bean Burger is a great addition to our meal for a healthier balance and to cater to any of our potential guests who may prefer a vegetarian option.

So, it seems we're all in agreement on choosing American Flavors USA for our meal. Let's consider a list of dishes that will satisfy our cravings, offer a range of flavors, and accommodate our health-conscious approach. Shall we finalize our choices in the next round of discussion?

[Paula->all]: I'm happy to see we're all reaching a consensus on returning to American Flavors USA. Our previous dining experiences there have indeed been more favorable compared to Classic American Bistro. The menu at American Flavors USA also seems to align nicely with my love for Greek food, offering bold and spicy options that I find appealing.

Felix's idea of ordering a variety of dishes for sharing is fantastic, as it reflects my outgoing personality and love for tasting different flavors. I'm especially eager to try the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers, as they both sound like they pack the kind of punch I enjoy in a meal.

In addition to what's already been suggested, I'd like to add the Smokin' Hot Brisket to our list, as it's received positive feedback and seems to embody the robust flavors we're seeking. Plus, it's always good to have a balance of chicken and beef options on the table.

Overall, I'm excited about our meal at American Flavors USA and looking forward to finalizing our dish selections in the next round. Let's aim to cover a wide range of flavors to ensure a delightful dining experience for all of us. Shall we proceed with drafting our final order?

[William->all]: It's our sixth day of dining out, and I must say, American Flavors USA has been quite impressive with their offerings, especially the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken which I've found to be consistently delightful. Given my preference for Japanese cuisine, I haven't found an option that directly satisfies that craving, but the freshness and flavor profiles at American Flavors USA have been a good substitute in the meantime. The service has been great as well, which is important to me as a reserved individual. What are your thoughts on giving Classic American Bistro another try or sticking with what we've been enjoying at American Flavors USA?

[Felix->all]: I appreciate the consistent quality we've experienced at American Flavors USA, and it's clear from our previous scores that we've all enjoyed our meals there. However, as an analytical person with a middle-class income, I think it's also important to consider variety and perhaps give Classic American Bistro another chance. Their revamped menu with locally-sourced ingredients could offer us a fresh experience. I do have a preference for Chinese cuisine, but given the two options, I can find enjoyment in the bold flavors and healthier options that both restaurants offer. Classic American Bistro's Superfood Caesar Salad and the Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon seem like dishes that could align with my taste and health considerations. What do the rest of you think about trying something different tonight or should we stick to the familiar?

[Xavier->all]: Well, I've got to say, I've really been enjoying the Caribbean-like flavors over at American Flavors USA. The spice and zest in dishes like the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers have been hitting the spot for me. Given my vibrant personality, I've been loving the energy of the place and the bold flavors they're serving up. I'm healthy, have no dietary restrictions, and the prices are within my middle-class budget, so I've been more than satisfied with our choice so far.

That said, I'm always up for switching things up and trying new flavors, especially since I'm all about vibrant experiences. The Classic American Bistro's advertisement about their new menu items with locally-sourced ingredients does sound tempting, and I'd be interested to see if their bold, innovative flavors could rival the deliciousness we've been getting at American Flavors USA. I'm intrigued by the Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon and the Ultimate Dream Burger – they could be a delightful change. So, I'm open to either option, really. Let's see what Paula has to say, and then perhaps we can make a decision?

[Paula->all]: Hey everyone, I've been enjoying our meals at American Flavors USA, and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was indeed a standout for me too. However, as much as I love Greek food, neither of our options offers that. But I'm always up for exploring different cuisines and flavors, and the service and quality at American Flavors USA have been very good, which is something I value as an outgoing person.

Even though I'm healthy and without dietary restrictions, I'm interested in the locally-sourced ingredients and new dishes at Classic American Bistro. Their Superfood Caesar Salad and the Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon could be a nice change of pace. It might also be refreshing to give our taste buds a new experience, considering we've been to American Flavors USA quite a few times now. I think it could be fun to mix it up and try Classic American Bistro tonight, and their prices seem reasonable within our middle-class budget. What do you all think? Should we go for the change or stick with the familiar and satisfying choice of American Flavors USA?

[William->all]: It's interesting to see that we all have a bit of curiosity about Classic American Bistro's new menu. Personally, I'm intrigued by the idea of trying something different for a change, especially since we've visited American Flavors USA for a few days in a row now. I believe that Classic American Bistro's commitment to locally-sourced ingredients and the introduction of bold flavors might give us a pleasant surprise, aligning with my preference for fresh and well-crafted dishes. Plus, their menu does have a few items that seem appealing to me, like the Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon which could potentially offer a similar satisfaction to my favored Japanese cuisine with its emphasis on fresh, quality seafood. Shall we consider giving Classic American Bistro a chance tonight, then summarize our thoughts and make a final decision?

[Felix->all]: I'm in agreement with giving Classic American Bistro a try. It's important to keep an open mind and explore different options, as it's easy to become too comfortable with one place. Trying a new restaurant can be an exciting experience, and it fits within our middle-class budget, which is an important consideration for me. Both options have their merits, but a change could be refreshing. I'm leaning towards the Superfood Caesar Salad and Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon, as they seem to offer the healthier options that I prefer. If we all are leaning towards trying something new, I think we should go ahead and make it official in our next round of discussion. What are your final thoughts?

[Xavier->all]: It seems we're leaning towards a bit of adventure by trying out Classic American Bistro tonight. I'm definitely intrigued by their new menu, particularly the Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon and the Ultimate Dream Burger. They sound like they could provide that vibrant flavor experience I'm always chasing. Plus, it's nice to support local sourcing when we can. I think it's worth taking the chance to see if their bold, innovative flavors can impress us as much as American Flavors USA has. So, I'm in favor of trying out Classic American Bistro this evening. How about we finalize this decision in the next round? If everyone's on board, we can move forward with selecting our dishes. What does everyone say?

[Paula->all]: It looks like we're all in agreement to give Classic American Bistro a shot tonight. I'm excited to see how their locally-sourced ingredients and new dishes compare to what we've had so far. The Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon and the Superfood Caesar Salad do sound promising, and it's always great to have a bit of variety in our dining experiences. Plus, it's been a while since we've tried something new, so this could be a refreshing change. If everyone else is ready, I think we can finalize our decision and pick out some dishes. Shall we go ahead and make our selection from Classic American Bistro's menu for tonight's meal?

[William->all]: The Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon was a fair dish with a nice balance of sweetness and savory, although it didn't quite hit the mark for me in terms of the vibrant flavors I was hoping for. The Superfood Caesar Salad was fresh but again, just fair in taste. I think we were all expecting a bit more given the anticipation of trying something new. Overall, I'd give each dish a 7 out of 10. They were good, but not as exceptional as I had hoped for. What do you all think?

[Felix->all]: The dishes at Classic American Bistro tonight were all quite consistent in quality, with each earning a fair score from me. The Superfood Caesar Salad was a highlight in terms of health, aligning with my preferences, but it didn't have the bold flavors I was looking for. The Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon was good but didn't particularly remind me of the Chinese cuisine I love. Each dish was good but not outstanding, so I’d give them a 7 out of 10 as well. They met my expectations for a middle-class dining experience but didn't exceed them. Shall we see how Xavier and Paula felt about their meals?

[Xavier->all]: The Classic American Bistro certainly has its charm with the locally-sourced ingredients, but I must admit, while the dishes like the Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon and the Ultimate Dream Burger were enjoyable, they didn't quite transport me to the Caribbean as I'd hoped. The flavors were vibrant enough to match my personality, but they didn't quite reach the high expectations I had set. The dishes were consistently fair across the board, each earning a solid 7 out of 10 from me. They were satisfying, but not to the point where I was blown away. Let's hear Paula's thoughts before we wrap up our discussion.

[Paula->all]: The dishes at Classic American Bistro tonight were certainly consistent, and it was nice to see the use of locally-sourced ingredients. However, none of the dishes really stood out as exceptional to me. As someone who loves Greek food, I was looking for bold flavors and something that could excite my palate in a similar way. The Superfood Caesar Salad and the Maple-Glazed Wild Salmon were good, but they didn't leave a lasting impression. I found the experience to be pleasant, but not remarkable. I would also rate each dish a 7 out of 10. They were all fair, but I was hoping for a more memorable dining experience. Let's summarize our final thoughts and give our group review.

[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.

[William->all]: Hello everyone, based on our past experiences and preferences, I think we should consider not only the flavors but also the service and consistency of the restaurant we choose. I have a penchant for Japanese cuisine, but I'm open to other options as long as the food is delicious and the service is good. From our past dining experiences, American Flavors USA seems to have a higher score and has been consistent with their service and quality of food. Their menu also seems to have a variety of flavorful options that could cater to our tastes. What does everyone else think?

[Felix->all]: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, William. As an analytical person with a middle-class income, I appreciate the importance of consistency and quality in dining experiences. My preference leans towards Chinese cuisine, but I'm open to exploring other culinary styles, especially since our options are limited to American cuisine at the moment.

From our previous experiences, it's evident that American Flavors USA has consistently provided a high-quality service and a variety of dishes that have been well-received by our group, scoring an 8 on multiple occasions. The "Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken" seems to be a recurring favorite, and the "Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers" could offer the complex flavors I tend to enjoy in Chinese cuisine.

On the other hand, the Classic American Bistro, despite its appealing advertisement and promising new dishes like the "Spicy Chipotle Chicken Bowl," seems to have a lower overall customer score and less enthusiastic comments regarding the flavors. Given our past experiences and my personal taste preferences, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA.

Let's hear from Xavier and Paula to see what they think before we make any decisions.

[Xavier->all]: Hello, William and Felix. I appreciate your insights. As someone with a vibrant personality who loves Caribbean cuisine, the ideal restaurant choice for me would be one that offers a balance of bold and spicy flavors that can kindle that Caribbean flair. Health-wise, I'm in good shape, so I am flexible with the menu options as long as they're not too heavy.

Reflecting on our previous dining experiences, American Flavors USA has consistently hit the mark with dishes like the "Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken" and "Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers," both of which offer a hint of the sweet and spicy profile I enjoy. The "Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp" also catches my eye due to its potential to deliver that piquant zest I crave. With our middle-class income, their pricing seems reasonable for the quality and variety they provide.

Classic American Bistro has an intriguing menu with the "Spicy Chipotle Chicken Bowl" standing out, but the overall customer score and our own group's ratings suggest that while they have a good foundation, they might not be as consistent as American Flavors USA in delivering the high-quality flavors we're after.

Let's see what Paula has to say, but so far, I'm inclined to agree with both of you on leaning towards American Flavors USA for our next dining experience.

[Paula->all]: Hello team, it's great to hear all of your thoughts. As someone who has a middle-class income and a taste for Greek food, I value meals that are both flavorful and provide a good dining experience. While we don't have a Greek option here, I'm looking for something with a complexity of flavors that can somewhat reflect the Mediterranean zest, perhaps through the use of fresh ingredients and herbs.

Health-wise, I'm in good shape and without dietary restrictions, which gives me flexibility. Being outgoing, I also appreciate a lively atmosphere and friendly service, something that seems to be a strong point for American Flavors USA according to our past experiences. Their menu options like the "Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken" and "Southwest Spiced Steak" seem promising, and they could potentially satisfy my craving for bold flavors.

Considering the consistent high scores and positive comments for American Flavors USA, I'm also leaning towards dining there. The Classic American Bistro seems to have some appealing new dishes, but the lower customer score and our group's lukewarm experiences make me hesitant to choose them over a restaurant that we've had great experiences with.

I'm curious to see if we're all in agreement or if there are any other opinions before we come to a decision. Shall we go through another round of discussion or are we ready to propose a final solution?

[William->all]: It seems we've all shared similar opinions regarding our dining choices. American Flavors USA has consistently provided us with a high-quality dining experience, and their menu items have been well-received by our group. Given that we all have no dietary restrictions and are in good health, we can enjoy a range of dishes from their menu. The "Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken" and "Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers" have been mentioned as favorites by multiple members, and there seems to be a general consensus towards choosing American Flavors USA over Classic American Bistro due to the former's higher customer score and positive feedback.

If no one has any objections or further points to add, I believe we might be ready to move into the second round and look towards proposing a final decision. Shall we discuss potential dishes to order from American Flavors USA? We should consider getting a variety that caters to our individual tastes while also trying something new, like the "Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp" that Xavier mentioned. What are your thoughts on the dishes we should order?

[Felix->all]: William, Xavier, and Paula, I'm pleased to see that we're all aligned in our preferences towards American Flavors USA. The menu items that have been highlighted so far not only reflect the quality that we're seeking but also seem to offer a satisfying range of flavors that cater to our diverse palates.

I agree with William’s suggestion of considering both our favorites and new dishes. The "Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken" and "Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers" are definite must-haves based on our past positive experiences. Additionally, Xavier's interest in the "Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp" aligns with our group's desire for bold and adventurous flavors.

Considering our group size and varied tastes, I suggest we also include a vegetarian option like the "Grilled Portobello Burger" to add diversity to our meal. It can offer an alternative perspective on the flavors American Flavors USA has to offer. Furthermore, a classic like the "BBQ Ribs" could complement our selection by providing a traditional American dish with a homemade touch.

Before we finalize, I would like to hear if there are any other dishes that you all would like to add to our selection, or if there are any adjustments needed to cater to everyone's taste and dietary preferences. Shall we finalize our choices in the next round to proceed with our dining experience at American Flavors USA?

[Xavier->all]: I'm glad to see that we're all on the same page about choosing American Flavors USA. It definitely caters to my love for vibrant and bold flavors. The "Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken" and the "Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers" sound like they would certainly satisfy my Caribbean taste buds. The suggestion for the "Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp" by myself earlier still stands, as I think it would be a delightful addition to our meal.

Felix's idea of including the "Grilled Portobello Burger" is excellent, as it not only adds variety but also offers a vegetarian option that could be a delightful surprise. The "BBQ Ribs" William mentioned would indeed provide that classic American taste to round off our meal.

I don't have any further dishes to add; I think we have a good selection that caters to everyone's tastes. If everyone is in agreement with the proposed dishes, I believe we can move to the next round and finalize our decision. Shall we proceed?

[William->all]: Based on our previous experiences and considering my personal preferences for sushi and Japanese cuisine, I suggest we try something different from our usual choices. Neither restaurant specializes in Japanese cuisine, but American Flavors USA seems to have a more diverse menu with healthier options. This could be a good compromise for my tastes. Plus, the overall scores we've given are consistently higher for American Flavors USA. What does everyone else think?

[Felix->all]: [William], I appreciate your suggestion of American Flavors USA for its diversity and healthier options. As someone with a preference for Chinese cuisine, I tend to favor dishes that offer a balance of flavors and a bit of a kick, something which seems feasible with the options at American Flavors USA. Their "Smokin' Hot Brisket" and "Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers" caught my eye as they may satisfy my craving for bold flavors. Additionally, the consistent high scores for American Flavors USA indicate a reliable dining experience. Let's hear from [Xavier] and [Paula] for their preferences and see if we can reach a consensus.

[Xavier->all]: [William] and [Felix], I agree that American Flavors USA seems to have a diverse menu that could potentially offer a slice of the Caribbean flavors I enjoy, particularly with dishes that feature a blend of sweet, savory, and spicy elements. I must say, the "Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken" and the "Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp" sound like they could be reminiscent of the aromatic and vibrant tastes I'm fond of. The consistent high scores for American Flavors USA also suggest that we'll likely have a good dining experience there. I'm interested to hear [Paula]'s thoughts before we make a final decision.

[Paula->all]: I'm glad to hear everyone leaning towards American Flavors USA, as it aligns with my preferences too. As a fan of Greek food, I appreciate fresh, flavorful dishes with a bit of zest. Options like the "Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken" and the "Zesty Black Bean Burger" seem like they could offer some of that Mediterranean flair with their use of herbs and spices. I'm also health-conscious, so it's great to see a variety of healthier options on their menu. Given our previous experiences and consistent high scores for American Flavors USA, I'm all for giving it another try tonight. Shall we start thinking about which dishes to order?

[William->all]: It seems like we're all in agreement about choosing American Flavors USA for our meal tonight. Given our various tastes and the healthy, flavorful options on the menu, I think it's the best fit for us. We should look at selecting dishes that reflect a bit of each of our preferred cuisines to create a well-rounded meal. I suggest we include the "Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken" and "Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp" that [Xavier] mentioned, as well as the "Zesty Black Bean Burger" that [Paula] is interested in. I would also like to add the "Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers" that [Felix] brought up, and perhaps the "Grilled Portobello Burger" for a vegetarian option. Now, let's decide on the final dishes to order and make our evening enjoyable for everyone.

[Felix->all]: I concur with the choices so far for American Flavors USA. The "Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken" and "Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp" will certainly please [Xavier] and [Paula], and I'm looking forward to the "Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers". The "Zesty Black Bean Burger" also sounds intriguing and could be a delightful vegetarian option alongside the "Grilled Portobello Burger". To round out our meal and to make sure we have enough food for everyone, I suggest we add the "BBQ Ribs" and the "New York Cheesecake" for dessert, as they are likely to be crowd-pleasers. How does this sound to the group for our final order?

[William->all]: Hey everyone, considering our recent dining experiences and my personal preferences, I would lean towards trying something different from our usual American cuisine choices. My palate is more inclined towards Japanese flavors, particularly sushi and related dishes. Although neither of the available restaurants specializes in Japanese cuisine, I'm curious to see if either menu offers something that leans towards those flavors or at least offers a refreshing change. I'm also health-conscious, so a dish with fresh ingredients and a balance of proteins and greens would be ideal. What do you all think?

[Felix->all]: Hello team, Felix here. I've noticed that we've been favoring American Flavors USA quite a bit, and while the experiences there have been consistently good, I'm thinking we might consider giving Classic American Bistro another chance to see how they've improved. As you all know, my taste leans heavily towards Chinese cuisine, but I'm open to exploring different flavors as long as they offer a complexity similar to what I enjoy in Asian dishes. From the menu at Classic American Bistro, the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl sounds like it might have that depth of flavor with its smokiness and use of cilantro-lime, which are somewhat reminiscent of the vibrant flavors I love.

On the health front, I'm in good shape and open to a variety of options, as long as the dishes are well-balanced nutritionally. The Garden Harvest Veggie Burger with Sweet Potato Fries could be a good vegetarian choice that seems fulfilling and hearty. Given my analytical nature, I'm looking at the overall customer scores and comments, and it seems Classic American Bistro has room for improvement, but they could surprise us with their updated offerings. What are your thoughts on giving Classic American Bistro another try or sticking with American Flavors USA? Let's discuss and find a satisfying choice for all of us.

[Xavier->all]: Hey team, Xavier here. I appreciate the robust flavors we've experienced at American Flavors USA, but I'm also open to exploring what Classic American Bistro has to offer. My taste gravitates towards Caribbean cuisine, so I'm always on the lookout for dishes that bring a bit of that island spice and zest to the table. 

Looking at the menus, I see potential in Classic American Bistro's Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl, which might have that kick of flavor I enjoy. However, American Flavors USA has consistently catered to my preference for spicy and savory dishes, like the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken.

Health-wise, I'm in good shape and don't have any dietary restrictions, so I'm quite flexible when it comes to choosing. Considering the group's inclination for variety and the need to keep things fresh, I'm supportive of giving Classic American Bistro another visit. It's important for us to experience a range of culinary offerings, and perhaps they've stepped up their game since our last visit.

In terms of service, our experiences at American Flavors USA have been great, but it doesn't hurt to see if Classic American Bistro can match that level of service and quality now. I'm all for a vibrant atmosphere, and if Classic American Bistro can provide that along with some flavorful dishes, I'd be happy to dine there. Shall we take a vote on giving Classic American Bistro a try or do you folks want to stick with our tried and true American Flavors USA? Let's hash it out and come to a consensus.

[Paula->all]: Hey everyone, Paula here. I've been enjoying our meals at American Flavors USA but I must admit, I have a soft spot for Greek food, which means I'm always up for dishes that include fresh ingredients like olives, feta, and herbs. I don't see exactly those flavors on either menu, but I am always excited about trying new things.

While Classic American Bistro doesn't have a Greek salad, their menu does have some fresh options that could be reminiscent of Mediterranean cuisine, such as the Energizing Superfood Caesar and the Autumn Chicken & Pomegranate Salad. These dishes seem to have that fresh and herby profile I love. The customer score is a bit lower for Classic American Bistro, but I feel like we should give them a chance to impress us with their improvements.

Health and freshness are important to me, and I appreciate dishes that are well-prepared and made with quality ingredients. I believe we've given American Flavors USA a good run and we've mostly enjoyed it, but I agree with Felix and Xavier that it might be time to see if the other restaurant has stepped up their game.

From a service perspective, we've had good experiences at American Flavors USA, but I'm curious to see if Classic American Bistro can provide us with an equally delightful experience. Since I'm outgoing, I also look forward to a lively atmosphere, and I'm hoping Classic American Bistro can offer that along with some delicious dishes.

What do you all think about giving Classic American Bistro a shot for our next meal? I think it's worth exploring their menu, especially since they might have dishes that align with my taste preferences. Let's take a vote and decide where we'll be dining next!

[William->all]: I've listened to everyone's input, and it seems we're leaning towards giving Classic American Bistro another chance. Felix and Xavier have pointed out some potentially flavorful options that could satisfy our diverse tastes. Paula has also highlighted dishes with fresh and herby profiles, which align with my preference for Japanese cuisine in terms of the emphasis on freshness.

From my perspective, the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl and the Autumn Chicken & Pomegranate Salad at Classic American Bistro could offer a healthier choice with the vibrant flavors I enjoy. Even though these aren't Japanese dishes, they seem to incorporate the fresh and balanced approach that I value in a meal.

Considering the group's interest in variety and the fact that we've been frequenting American Flavors USA quite a bit, I'm on board with trying out Classic American Bistro again. It's important to keep our dining experiences diverse, and it could be a pleasant surprise to see how they've evolved.

In terms of service, we know what to expect from American Flavors USA, but I'm open to seeing if Classic American Bistro has improved in this area as well. Since we're all in agreement on trying something different, I propose that we give Classic American Bistro another opportunity to impress us. If everyone is in agreement, we can finalize this decision in the next round of our discussion. Shall we take a vote?

[Felix->all]: I've reviewed everyone's comments and it seems like we are collectively inclined towards giving Classic American Bistro another chance to see how they've stepped up their game. I'm personally intrigued by the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl, as it appears to offer the complexity of flavors I'm drawn to. The Garden Harvest Veggie Burger also catches my attention for a vegetarian option. 

Since I don't have any dietary restrictions and I'm in good health, I'm willing to explore options that may not be specifically within my usual preference for Chinese cuisine. It's also clear that while we've had good experiences at American Flavors USA, the group is ready for a change.

William, Xavier, and Paula have all expressed interest in dishes at Classic American Bistro that align with their tastes and health considerations. We are looking for fresh, quality ingredients and a lively atmosphere, which Classic American Bistro seems capable of providing based on their advertisement and menu options.

I agree with William's proposal to give Classic American Bistro another try. If everyone is still in agreement, we can move forward with this decision and select our dishes in the next round of our discussion. Shall we proceed with this plan?

[Xavier->all]: I've read through all the comments, and I'm glad to see we're considering giving Classic American Bistro a shot. I'm particularly drawn to the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl, which seems like it could have that Caribbean zest I enjoy. Also, the American Dream Deluxe Burger with its smoked bacon and dream sauce on a brioche bun could potentially offer a savory indulgence that suits my vibrant personality.

Health is not a concern for me as I am in good shape, and since I have no dietary restrictions, I'm open to exploring the various options offered by Classic American Bistro. The restaurant's commitment to locally-sourced ingredients and the introduction of bold flavors in their revamped menu are appealing.

Service-wise, while we've had a good run with American Flavors USA, I'm curious to see if Classic American Bistro can match or exceed the service we've come to enjoy. Trying out a different restaurant also aligns with my vibrant and adventurous nature.

In summary, I'm in agreement with William, Felix, and Paula about giving Classic American Bistro another opportunity to impress us with their culinary offerings and service. If we are all still on the same page, we can finalize our decision to visit Classic American Bistro for our next meal in the following round of our discussion. Shall we proceed with selecting our dishes from Classic American Bistro, everyone?

[Paula->all]: It sounds like we've reached a consensus to try Classic American Bistro and give them a chance to impress us with their updated menu. I'm excited about the prospect of trying their dishes that have a fresh and herby profile which speaks to my love for Greek food. The Energizing Superfood Caesar and the Autumn Chicken & Pomegranate Salad seem like great choices that align with my taste preferences. Also, considering William's, Felix's, and Xavier's interest in options like the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl and the American Dream Deluxe Burger, it seems that there will be something for everyone.

I'm all for a change and think that Classic American Bistro's commitment to bold flavors and locally-sourced ingredients might provide us with a new and delightful dining experience. Let's go ahead and make our selections from Classic American Bistro, keeping in mind everyone's preferences for health, flavor, and variety. Shall we finalize our choices in the next round of discussion? What does everyone think about the dishes we've mentioned so far? Are there any other dishes on the menu that anyone would like to try or should we focus on the ones we've discussed?

[William->all]: I've been reviewing our past experiences, and while we've had some decent meals at both Classic American Bistro and American Flavors USA, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA for our next outing. The flavors there seem to be more robust and the dishes have consistently scored higher with our group. I'm particularly drawn to their health-conscious options and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp sounds delightful. I do have a preference for Japanese cuisine, but in the absence of such options, American Flavors USA's innovative dishes seem to be the next best thing. What do you all think?

[Felix]: I'm on board with that, William. American Flavors USA has been a great spot for us, and their menu has a lot of variety, which I appreciate. I've been eyeing the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken again—it was a highlight for me last time.

[Xavier]: I'm glad we're considering American Flavors USA again. Their dishes have been consistently good, and I actually like the sound of the spicy options like the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers. It aligns well with my taste for Caribbean flavors.

[Paula]: I'm happy with either restaurant, but I do remember enjoying the health-conscious choices at American Flavors USA. The Harvest Veggie Stack caught my eye—it sounds like a flavorful vegetarian option. Let's go for American Flavors USA!

[William]: It seems we're all in agreement then. Shall we finalize this in our next round of discussion? If anyone has any specific dishes they'd like to add, let's bring that up now so we can include it in our final decision.

[Felix->all]: It looks like American Flavors USA has our vote, and I’m definitely looking forward to trying the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken again. Considering our group's diverse tastes and the previous positive feedback, this restaurant seems to cater well to us all. I also think the Harvest Veggie Stack would be a nice addition to our order for a vegetarian option, as Paula mentioned. Additionally, the Zesty Black Bean Burger might be a good choice for something different and health-focused. I'd like to hear if anyone has other dish suggestions or if we're ready to move towards finalizing our choices.

[Xavier->all]: I'm definitely excited to head back to American Flavors USA. The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers will be on my list for sure, and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp that William mentioned sounds like a great choice as well. It's nice to see that they have plenty of options that cater to a vibrant and hearty taste like mine. Seeing as we all have a dish we're eyeing, I think we're just about ready to make a final decision. If anyone wants to add another dish or two to round out our meal, now's the time! Otherwise, I'm ready to finalize our choices in the next round.

[Paula->all]: I'm glad to see we're all on the same page with American Flavors USA. The menu certainly has a lot to offer, and it's great that we've found dishes that cater to each of our preferences. Since we're all looking at various dishes, I'd like to throw in the Cobb Salad for a refreshing start to our meal. It has that zestier dressing that could be a nice palate opener. With the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, Harvest Veggie Stack, Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers, and Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, it seems we have a good variety. If everyone's content with these choices, I think we can finalize our order in the next round of discussion. Does anyone have any other dishes to add or any other thoughts before we wrap this up?

[William->all]: Hello everyone, considering our previous dining experiences and my personal preferences for health-conscious options, I'd like to suggest that we consider going back to American Flavors USA. I have a taste for sushi and Japanese cuisine, and while neither restaurant offers this specifically, American Flavors USA has dishes like the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp that seem to align with my flavor preferences. Also, their menu options seem to be more health-oriented, which is important to me. What do you all think?

[Felix]: I'm open to going back to American Flavors USA. I've enjoyed the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken in the past, and it looks like they still have it on the menu. Plus, their score has been pretty consistent with us, which is reassuring.

[Xavier]: I'd like to add that American Flavors USA has been providing us with good service, and I've noticed they have some spicy options like the Southwest Spiced Steak, which I'm inclined to try. The health-conscious aspect is a bonus for me as well.

[Paula]: I agree with the points made. American Flavors USA has been a solid choice for us, and their dishes have been quite satisfying. I also appreciate that they have vegetarian options like the Harvest Veggie Stack, which is great for me as I prefer to keep my meals light and healthy. 

[William]: It seems we're leaning towards American Flavors USA. Shall we discuss which dishes we'd like to order before we make the final decision? I'm interested in the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and perhaps the Cobb Salad for a lighter option. What would you all like?

[Felix->all]: I think we're on the right track with American Flavors USA. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken sounds delicious, and I'd like to have it again. Also, considering our health-conscious preferences, the Harvest Veggie Stack might be a good choice for the table as well. It would be nice to have a variety of dishes, so I'm also interested in trying the Zesty Black Bean Burger. What does everyone else think about these choices?

[Xavier->all]: I'm with you on the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, Felix. It's been a hit in the past, and I think it'll be a good choice again. I'm also really looking forward to trying the Southwest Spiced Steak for that spicy kick I enjoy. And since I'm all about vibrant flavors, the Zesty Black Bean Burger sounds like it would hit the spot. Maybe we could also consider the Smokin' Hot Brisket for some variety in proteins. What do you say, Paula? Any preferences on your end?

[Paula->all]: I'm definitely in favor of American Flavors USA. Given that we've had good experiences there and the menu caters to our health-conscious group, it seems like the best choice. The Harvest Veggie Stack caught my eye as a dish I'd enjoy, and I think the Cobb Salad would be a refreshing addition to our meal. I'm also curious about the Sunset Berry Cheesecake—it may be a delightful way to end our meal on a sweet note. William's and Felix's suggestions sound good to me, and Xavier's pick of the Southwest Spiced Steak would add a nice variety to our order. Shall we finalize our selections in the next round?

[William->all]: Hello everyone, given my preference for Japanese cuisine, neither American Flavors USA nor Classic American Bistro aligns perfectly with my tastes. However, I have enjoyed the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken at American Flavors USA in the past. Looking at both menus, I'm inclined to lean towards American Flavors USA because they seem to have a few healthier options, like the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl, which might satisfy my preference for more health-conscious meals. What are your thoughts on where we should dine today?

[Felix->all]: Hello everyone, since my preference leans towards Chinese cuisine, I'm always on the lookout for flavors that offer a balance of sweet, savory, and a hint of spice. Between American Flavors USA and Classic American Bistro, it seems American Flavors USA has dishes that might hit closer to that mark, such as the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and the Southwest Spiced Steak, which we have enjoyed before. I'm also quite analytical, so I've noticed that our past experiences at American Flavors USA have been consistently good, with individual scores never dropping below 7, which speaks to their quality. In terms of my health and lack of dietary restrictions, I am open to most options, but the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl catches my eye as a nutritious choice. Let's discuss further and come to a decision that satisfies us all.

[Xavier->all]: Hi William and Felix, I hear your preferences and I think we can find a good middle ground. I personally have a love for Caribbean cuisine, which often features an array of spices, vibrant flavors, and a mix of sweet and savory. Given that, American Flavors USA seems like it could be a better fit for us today. They have dishes like the Southwest Spiced Steak that might offer the kick I enjoy from Caribbean dishes. Plus, their menu appears to have a variety of options that could cater to our health-conscious side, like the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl Felix mentioned.

I'm also considering the overall scores and comments from our previous experiences, and American Flavors USA has consistently scored higher than Classic American Bistro. We've had enjoyable times there, and it seems like a safe bet for a satisfying meal. I value vibrant atmospheres and flavors, and it seems like American Flavors USA has been able to provide that for us in the past. Let’s see what Paula thinks before we make our final decision.

[Paula->all]: Hello William, Felix, and Xavier, I appreciate everyone's input. As someone with a preference for Greek food, I am always looking for dishes that offer a blend of fresh and robust flavors. Between American Flavors USA and Classic American Bistro, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA because they offer dishes like the Southwest Spiced Steak and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, which seem to have the zest and spice reminiscent of Greek cuisine.

Moreover, I am healthy with no dietary restrictions, so I'm quite flexible with the menu options. American Flavors USA also appears to have a variety of dishes that cater to a health-conscious diet, such as the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl, which would be a great choice for our group.

Considering our previous experiences, American Flavors USA seems to have provided us with consistent quality and service, which is important to me as an outgoing person who values a good dining atmosphere. The scores have been fairly high, and even though there's room for improvement, the feedback has been generally positive.

Let's circle back after hearing everyone's preferences and see if we can reach a consensus on American Flavors USA or if Classic American Bistro might offer something that better suits our collective tastes for today's meal. What do you all think?

[William->all]: Thank you all for your insights. It seems we are all somewhat aligned in our preferences today, with a lean towards American Flavors USA. The dishes that have been highlighted, like the Southwest Spiced Steak and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl, are not only aligned with our group's health-conscious preferences but also seem to offer the kind of flavors that can cater to our varied tastes. In addition, the overall positive past experiences and consistent scores at American Flavors USA give me confidence that we will enjoy our meal there.

I would suggest we give American Flavors USA another visit today. They seem to have a good balance of dishes that can satisfy our health and flavor preferences. If everyone agrees, I think we can finalize this as our choice and look forward to another pleasant dining experience. Shall we proceed with American Flavors USA and select our dishes for the meal?

[Felix->all]: I agree with the consensus leaning towards American Flavors USA. The dishes mentioned do indeed seem to align with our group's preferences for health-conscious and flavorful meals. The Southwest Spiced Steak and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl are particularly appealing to me, and I think they would offer the right mix of nutrition and taste. Moreover, the consistent quality of our previous visits to American Flavors USA suggests that we're likely to enjoy our dining experience there once again.

Given the analytical approach to our decision-making process and the positive reflections on past experiences, I propose we choose American Flavors USA for our dining destination today. If we're all in agreement, in the next round, we can move on to selecting the specific dishes we'd like to order. Does that sound good to everyone?

[Xavier->all]: I'm on board with the decision to head to American Flavors USA.

It sounds like it could be reminiscent of the bold Caribbean flavors I adore. Plus, I'm all for a health-conscious option like the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl to balance out the meal.

[William->all]: The Southwest Spiced Steak had a nice kick and was cooked to perfection, a solid good in my book. I'd rate it a 7.4. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was fresh and satisfying, and I appreciate the health aspect of it, so I'll give it a 7.0. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was deliciously flavored and well-prepared; I'd rate it a 7.5. Lastly, the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme was tender and had a nice glaze, deserving a 7.2. Overall, it was a good dining experience, matching our expectations from previous visits.

[Felix->all]: The Southwest Spiced Steak was indeed a highlight with its balance of spices; I'd agree with William and give it a 7.4. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl, while not as flavorful as I typically prefer, was a healthy option that I'd rate at 7.0. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp hit the mark with its zest and earns a 7.5 from me. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme was quite good, with a balance of sweet and savory that I enjoyed, so I'll rate it a 7.2. American Flavors USA maintained their standard with these dishes.

The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was absolutely delightful, with the right amount of garlic and butter enhancing the shrimp's natural flavor; it deserves a 7.5. Finally, the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme was savory with a hint of sweetness, very satisfying, earning a 7.2. The overall experience was consistent with the restaurant's high standards.

[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[William->all]: Based on our previous experiences, I've noticed that we consistently enjoyed the meals at American Flavors USA, particularly drawn to dishes like the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and Southwest Spiced Steak. As someone who has a preference for Japanese cuisine, I appreciate fresh and bold flavors, which American Flavors USA seems to offer consistently. While Classic American Bistro has its charm with dishes like the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature, I feel American Flavors USA might have a slight edge in terms of the food's flavor profile and creativity. The service at both restaurants has been good, but I'd lean towards American Flavors USA for tonight's dinner. What do you all think?

[Felix->all]: William, I see your point about American Flavors USA. I share your appreciation for bold and fresh flavors, especially considering my preference for Chinese cuisine. However, I must admit that the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature at Classic American Bistro sounds tempting with its coffee rub and bourbon-mushroom sauce. As an analytical person, I'm inclined to consider our previous scores and experiences as well. I've noticed that our scores for American Flavors USA have slightly decreased over the last few visits, with comments suggesting that there's room for improvement in flavor and creativity. Classic American Bistro, on the other hand, seems to have gained momentum with consistent scores and comments praising their flavors and service. I'm inclined to suggest giving Classic American Bistro another chance, particularly to try out their new signature dish. I'm open to further discussion and would like to hear what Xavier and Paula think before making a final decision.

[Xavier->all]: I hear both of you, and while I've enjoyed our visits to American Flavors USA, I'm inclined to side with Felix on this one. My taste for Caribbean cuisine makes me crave dishes with a bold and vibrant profile, and although American Flavors USA has delivered that in the past, the recent comments suggest a small dip in their performance. I'm curious about the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature at Classic American Bistro, as it seems like a dish that could pack the punch of flavors I'm looking for. Given that the scores for Classic American Bistro have been consistently solid according to the recent comments, I think it could be worth exploring. Plus, the change of scenery might be refreshing for us as well. Paula, what are your thoughts on this? Let's try to come to a consensus so we can enjoy a great meal together.

[Paula->all]: Hey everyone, I've been listening to your points, and I must say, they're all valid. As much as I adore Greek food and the fresh, herby, and robust flavors that come with it, I think I'm leaning more towards giving Classic American Bistro a try this evening. The Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature sounds like it could be a delightful dish with deep, rich flavors that I might enjoy, and the change could be a nice switch from our usual picks. It's also great to see that their scores have been consistently good, and it seems like they've been making an effort to cater to diverse tastes and dietary preferences, which is always a plus. I think we'd all benefit from mixing it up a bit, and who knows, this could be a new favorite for us. Let's discuss a bit more and see if we can reach an agreement by the next round.

[William->all]: I appreciate everyone's input, and it seems we're leaning toward trying out Classic American Bistro tonight. Felix and Xavier's points about the potential of the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature and the consistently good scores have swayed me a bit. I do value variety and trying new things, and it appears that Classic American Bistro might provide us with a fresh experience. Plus, their menu does seem to offer a good balance between traditional flavors and some healthier options, which aligns with our group's preferences. Given that my taste for Japanese cuisine isn't directly catered to at either restaurant, I'm happy to explore other flavors, especially if they're executed well. If we all agree, I think we should give Classic American Bistro a chance tonight and see how their signature dish and other menu items fare. Shall we finalize this in the next round?

I thoroughly enjoyed the spice and sweetness balance in the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe, and the desserts, particularly the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait, were a refreshing finish to our meal.

The Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken was a refreshing dish, with the citrus providing a nice tang. The Hearty Colonial Beef Stew was comforting and rich, making it a perfect dish for any evening. I also enjoyed the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe, which had the right amount of smokiness and tenderness. For dessert, both the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait and the Classic American Apple Pie were sweet, satisfying, and provided a nice conclusion to our meal.

[William->all]: Hello everyone, considering our past experiences at both Classic American Bistro and American Flavors USA, I've noticed that we have slightly higher overall satisfaction at American Flavors USA. However, given my personal preference for Japanese cuisine, neither restaurant is an ideal fit for my taste. Still, I understand we need to make a choice between the two. I'm healthy with no dietary restrictions, so I'm flexible in that regard. Given my reserved nature, I do appreciate a place that isn't too loud or busy. Based on the menus, the Bold American Bison Burger at Classic American Bistro sounds intriguing, and it's been advertised as a new sensation. Perhaps we could consider giving this dish a try if we opt for Classic American Bistro. What are your thoughts and preferences this time around?

[Felix->all]: Hi everyone, I'm leaning towards Classic American Bistro today. Although I have a strong preference for Chinese cuisine, the menu items at Classic American Bistro seem to offer a variety of flavors that might provide an interesting culinary experience. The 'Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature' and 'Bold American Bison Burger' caught my attention, and I think they could be a good change of pace for us. Additionally, the higher customer score for our last visit there indicates we had a very good experience. Health-wise, I'm in good shape, so I'm open to trying out these rich dishes. I'd like to hear what Xavier and Paula think before we make a decision. What are your preferences today, and how do you feel about the options at Classic American Bistro?

[Xavier->all]: Hey team, I'm feeling the vibe for Classic American Bistro today. They've got several dishes that resonate with my Caribbean palate, especially the 'Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe' which reminds me of the flavors back home. Given that I'm all about vibrant and bold tastes, and considering we've had consistent scores at Classic American Bistro, I think it could be a great choice for us. I'm healthy, so no dietary restrictions to worry about, and I'm in the mood for something hearty and flavorful. I'm also intrigued by the 'Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken' and the 'Freedom Trail Chili'. Let's not forget the 'Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait' for a sweet finish! Paula, what are you thinking? Are you on board with Classic American Bistro, or do you have a different preference?

[Paula->all]: Hey team, I'm definitely feeling inclined towards Classic American Bistro as well. My love for Greek food draws me to dishes with rich and robust flavors, and it looks like Classic American Bistro offers a variety of options that can satisfy that craving. The 'Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature' has been a highlight in past reviews, and I'm curious to try the 'Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken' for something that might echo the lemony zest often found in Greek cuisine. I'm also tempted by the 'Bold American Bison Burger' – it sounds like a unique dish that I don't get to try every day. I'm healthy and without dietary restrictions, and my outgoing personality makes me feel comfortable in a vibrant atmosphere, which seems to match the environment at Classic American Bistro. So I'm all for giving Classic American Bistro another visit today. Shall we go for a round of agreeing on the specific dishes to order?
