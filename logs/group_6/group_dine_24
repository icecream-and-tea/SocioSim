[Jake->all]: Given my preferences and dietary restrictions, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA. They offer a Classic American Burger and BBQ Ribs, which cater to my taste for fried food. Also, their prices are slightly lower, which is better suited for my income level. I have to be careful with my high blood pressure and low sodium diet, so I might avoid the BBQ sauce if it's too salty, but I can enjoy the ribs without it. I can also opt for the Cobb Salad, which seems like a healthier option without compromising on taste. The ambiance of both places sounds great, so service and delicious food are my main considerations. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: I'm with Jake on this one; American Flavors USA seems like a good fit for me too. The prices are more in line with my budget, and the menu items like the Classic American Burger and BBQ Ribs are right up my alley since I love street food. Plus, I'm always looking for value, and their portions seem generous for the price. I don't have any dietary restrictions, so I'm free to choose from the whole menu. The Fried Chicken Basket sounds hearty and comforting. Since I’m resourceful, I believe we can get a good meal at American Flavors USA without breaking the bank. What do others think? Shall we go for American Flavors USA for some classic, affordable American eats?

[Quinn->all]: I'm inclined to agree with Jake and Brian. I favor spicy food, and both restaurants have buffalo wings, which is perfect for my taste buds. However, looking at the menus, I see that American Flavors USA offers their Buffalo Wings at a slightly lower price than Classic American Bistro. Given that I'm middle-class, the more affordable prices at American Flavors USA are appealing.

I'm healthy with no dietary restrictions, which gives me the freedom to choose freely from the menu. Given my bold personality, I'm not afraid to try different flavors and dishes, and the variety at American Flavors USA seems to match that adventurous spirit.

Based on the menus, American Flavors USA also has a good balance of hearty and spicy options, which suits my preferences well. The Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Philly Cheesesteak are particularly enticing, and I think they'd pair nicely with the Buffalo Wings for a satisfying meal.

I propose we consider American Flavors USA for our meal. It matches our collective taste for American classics, caters to our various health and dietary considerations, and fits within our budget constraints. What do you all say?

[Jake->all]: It seems we are all in agreement that American Flavors USA is the best choice for us. The menu fits our taste for classic American dishes, and the prices are more suitable for our budgets. I think it's also important to mention that they offer healthier options like the Cobb Salad, which is a good fit for me considering my high blood pressure. I appreciate the variety that American Flavors USA offers, allowing us to indulge in our favorite fried foods while also having the option to choose something lighter if we wish.

Considering everyone's preferences and my own dietary needs, I propose we go with American Flavors USA. I would suggest that we try to order dishes that are lower in sodium when possible, and maybe share a few dishes to get a taste of everything. If everyone agrees, we can finalize this decision in the next round and select the specific dishes we'd like to order. How does that sound?

[Brian->all]: The consensus is clear, and I'm all for American Flavors USA. We're all drawn to the classic American fare and are mindful of our budgets, which makes this place a great match for us. I think sharing a variety of dishes is a smart move—it lets us sample more of the menu and keeps the meal interesting. 

For my part, I'd be excited to dive into their Classic American Burger and the Fried Chicken Basket, but I'm also open to trying a bit of the BBQ Ribs if we're sharing. The Pulled Pork Sandwich Quinn mentioned sounds like a delicious option too.

If there are no objections, I believe we're ready to move forward and pick out the specific dishes that will make up our meal at American Flavors USA. Let's ensure that we cover everyone's tastes and preferences while keeping an eye on portion sizes and prices. Looking forward to a great meal with you all!

[Jake->all]: Well, it looks like the dishes we had were all consistent in quality, each scoring the same. I'd honestly say that's a fair assessment. The Classic American Burger was decent, though nothing out of the ordinary, and the same goes for the BBQ Ribs. The Cobb Salad was fresh but again, nothing that wowed me. The Philly Cheesesteak and Buffalo Wings were tasty but could have used a bit more flavor. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was good, but I've had better, and the Fried Chicken Basket was enjoyable but not outstanding. I'd give each dish a 6 out of 10. They all met expectations but didn't exceed them. What do you guys think?

[Brian->all]: I agree with Jake's assessment. The food at American Flavors USA was consistently fair across the board. Each dish had its own merits but didn't quite hit the mark for being exceptional. The Classic American Burger was satisfactory but lacked a unique touch, and the same sentiment applies to the BBQ Ribs. The Cobb Salad was fresh but could have been more innovative. The Philly Cheesesteak and Buffalo Wings were decent but forgettable. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was good, but not memorable, and the Fried Chicken Basket was comforting but didn't stand out. Overall, I'd rate each dish a 6 out of 10 as well. They were all adequate, but I was hoping for a standout item. Let's hear from Quinn before we finalize our group review.

[Quinn->all]: The meal at American Flavors USA was consistent in quality, with each dish landing squarely in the realm of "fair." The Classic American Burger was a decent representation of what you'd expect, and the BBQ Ribs were tender but didn't bring any surprising elements to the table. The Cobb Salad's freshness was appreciated but it didn't leave a lasting impression. The Philly Cheesesteak and Buffalo Wings had good flavor but didn't pack the spicy punch I was looking for. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was enjoyable, yet it didn't differentiate itself from others I've tried. The Fried Chicken Basket was comforting, but again, not exceptional. I'd also give each dish a 6 out of 10. They were satisfactory and filled us up, but I didn't find the bold flavors I was hoping to experience. Shall we compile our final review?

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, I'm leaning towards giving Classic American Bistro a try today. They have a Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon that might be a good option for me considering my high blood pressure and the need for low-sodium dishes. Plus, their customer score is slightly higher than American Flavors USA, and that Smokey BBQ Ribs is tempting even though I should watch my fried food intake. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: Hey Jake, I hear you on the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon, it does sound like a healthy choice. Given my budget constraints and love for street food, I'm leaning more towards American Flavors USA. Their menu options like the Classic American Burger and Smokin' Hot Brisket are more in line with what I usually enjoy, and the prices seem a bit more affordable for me. Plus, I'm all about that hearty, flavorful food, and their new zesty dishes sound like they could hit the spot. Let's see what Quinn has to say.

[Quinn->all]: Both spots have their merits, but I'm all about the spice and bold flavors, so American Flavors USA is catching my eye with their Smokin' Hot Brisket and Zesty Black Bean Burger. These dishes seem like they'd satisfy my love for spicy food. Plus, they've got a decent customer score, and we all know that service can sometimes be hit or miss regardless of the score. I'm healthy and without dietary restrictions, so I'm ready for something that packs a punch. American Flavors USA seems like it could deliver that boldness I'm always chasing. What do you guys think about giving it a shot and spicing up our meal today?

[Jake->all]: I understand where you're both coming from. Brian, the affordability at American Flavors USA is definitely appealing, and Quinn, their spicy options sound great for you. I'm just a bit concerned about the sodium levels in the dishes like the Smokin' Hot Brisket and even the Classic American Burger. However, I'm willing to compromise since I can probably find something that fits my dietary needs. The Zesty Black Bean Burger could be a healthier choice for me, and I'm sure there's something else on the menu that I can enjoy without too much sodium. How about we go to American Flavors USA and each pick a dish that suits our individual tastes and needs? We'll make sure to keep it balanced and consider everyone's preferences.

[Brian->all]: I appreciate the consideration, Jake. It sounds like a plan to me. American Flavors USA seems like a good compromise where we can all find something that caters to our needs and preferences. Plus, I'm excited to try out those street food-inspired flavors they seem to offer. It looks like we're all on board with American Flavors USA, so let's pick our dishes and make it official in the next round of discussion. Quinn, have you decided what you're going to order?

[Quinn->all]: I've made my choice, and I'm definitely going for the Smokin' Hot Brisket because that spicy BBQ glaze is calling my name. I'm also thinking of getting the Zesty Black Bean Burger because it's always good to have a vegetarian option that's full of flavor. Brian, if you're looking for affordability and taste, maybe the Classic American Burger is the way to go? And Jake, the Zesty Black Bean Burger seems like a wise pick for you, health-wise. Let's finalize our order in the next round. What do you guys say?

[Jake->all]: Wow, I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the Zesty Black Bean Burger. It was flavorful, and the spices didn't overwhelm the taste. It felt like a good fit for my dietary needs, and I didn't miss the meat at all. I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10. What did you guys think of your dishes?

The price was also reasonable for the quality I got, so I'm quite satisfied with the choice. It feels good when a meal lives up to your expectations and doesn't break the bank. I'd rate it an 8 out of 10 as well. Quinn, how was the brisket?

[Quinn->all]: The Smokin' Hot Brisket was everything I hoped for – spicy, flavorful, and with a satisfying kick to it. The spicy BBQ glaze was just the right amount of heat for my taste. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was also a hit with its bold flavors; it's great to have a veggie option that doesn't skimp on taste. Both dishes for me are a solid 8 out of 10.

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, considering my high blood pressure and low sodium diet, I'm leaning more towards options that are healthier and not too heavy on salt or fried foods. That being said, American Flavors USA seems to have a couple of dishes that cater to my health needs, like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken. They've also received better reviews recently, and I've had a good experience there before. What do you guys think?

[Brian->all]: I'm all for a place that offers a good bang for the buck, and American Flavors USA seems to do just that. Since I enjoy street food, their menu with items like the Pulled Pork Sandwich and Smokin' Hot Brisket sounds right up my alley. Plus, I've had a positive experience there in the past, and it looks like the recent comments are all pretty favorable. I don't have any dietary restrictions to worry about, and their dishes seem hearty without being too pricey. It looks like a win for my taste and budget. How about you, Quinn?

[Quinn->all]: Hey Jake and Brian, I'm all in for some bold and spicy flavors, and it looks like American Flavors USA can deliver that punch with dishes like the Smokin' Hot Brisket and the Southwest Spiced Steak. Considering my preference for spicy food and having no dietary restrictions, I'd be quite interested in trying those. Plus, the comments indicate that the food is flavorful and the service is good, which suits my bold personality. Since I'm healthy and have no specific dietary needs, I'm open to a variety of options on their menu. Given that we've all had decent experiences there before and the recent feedback is positive, American Flavors USA seems like a great choice for our meal. Shall we discuss which specific dishes to order?

[Jake->all]: I'm glad we're all leaning towards American Flavors USA. I appreciate that they have options that can cater to my dietary restrictions. How about for our meal we choose some dishes that offer a mix of those hearty flavors Brian and Quinn like, as well as some healthier alternatives for me? I suggest we consider the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken as part of our order, for starters. Maybe we could also add a Cobb Salad to balance things out. What do you guys think about including some of these options?

[Brian->all]: Jake, those options sound great to me. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken will surely add some variety to our meal. I'm definitely in for the Pulled Pork Sandwich and would love to add the Smokin' Hot Brisket to our order. I think these would satisfy my craving for street food-style dishes. The Cobb Salad that you mentioned, Jake, would be a fresh addition too. Quinn, do you want to add anything else to the mix? Maybe one of the steaks or another hearty dish?

[Quinn->all]: Brian, Jake, I think we're on the right track with those selections. I'd love to add the Southwest Spiced Steak to our order for that extra kick of spice I enjoy. And how about we also try the Smokin' Hot Brisket? It's got that spicy BBQ glaze that I think I'd really like. So we have a good combination of healthy and hearty, spicy and savory. If everyone's good with this, I think we've got ourselves a solid meal plan at American Flavors USA. Shall we finalize this order then?

[Jake->all]: Hey team, considering our past experiences, I've been quite happy with American Flavors USA. They seem to have a variety of options that cater to my taste for fried food but also offer healthier, low-sodium choices like the Zesty Black Bean Burger, which is important for my high blood pressure. Plus, the service has been great! What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: I'm inclined to agree with you, Jake. My budget is tight, and considering that, American Flavors USA seems to offer a good balance between price and quality. Their menu has some street food-inspired options like the BBQ Ribs and Fried Chicken Basket that appeal to my taste, and the consistent high scores from our past experiences make me lean towards giving it another shot. Plus, I don't have any dietary restrictions to worry about, and it sounds like they have resourceful combinations that could satisfy our cravings. What do others think?

[Quinn->all]: Hey guys, Quinn here. I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA as well. I have a penchant for spicy food, and their Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and Smokin' Hot Brisket sound right up my alley. I also appreciate that they offer a mix of hearty and healthy options, which aligns with my aim to eat healthy. My middle-class income finds their prices reasonable, and there are no dietary restrictions to hold me back. Given that we've had good experiences there before and their service has been highlighted as excellent, I'm all for another meal at American Flavors USA. How about we give it a go?

[Jake->all]: I'm with you all on heading back to American Flavors USA. Their menu really does have something for everyone, and it's been a hit for us previously. The Zesty Black Bean Burger seems like a good choice for me since it's flavorful and should be lower in sodium. I also wouldn't mind trying the Cobb Salad, as it's a healthier option. Given our positive past experiences and the diverse menu that caters to our different tastes and health considerations, I say we stick with American Flavors USA. Shall we move into the next round and start thinking about which dishes we want to order?

[Brian->all]: I'm glad we're all on the same page about American Flavors USA. It's great to see that they have dishes that not only fit my budget but also my love for street food flavors. The Fried Chicken Basket and the Classic American Burger seem like they'd be right up my alley. Also, considering everyone's positive feedback about the service and past experiences, I think it's a good choice for us. Let's move on to the next round and hash out our final order. How do you feel about including the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and the Smokin' Hot Brisket as well, since Quinn mentioned a preference for spicy food? What are your thoughts on this, Quinn and Jake?

[Quinn->all]: I'm absolutely on board with including the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and the Smokin' Hot Brisket in our order. They'll satisfy my spicy food cravings perfectly.

If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, I'm leaning towards giving Classic American Bistro a try today. Despite our repeated enjoyable experiences at American Flavors USA, I think it's nice to change things up a bit. Plus, the Classic Cheeseburger and the Heartland Veggie Burger seem like they could be up my alley, fried and hearty as I like, just as long as they can accommodate a low sodium request for my health. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: Jake, I understand the appeal of switching things up, but my budget consciousness is nudging me towards American Flavors USA. They've consistently offered us great value for the price, and we have all rated them highly over the past few days. Their menu also aligns more with my street food taste. That Zesty Black Bean Burger sounds really promising, and the BBQ Ribs are right up my street food alley. Plus, the prices are more in line with what I can comfortably afford. What about Quinn, any thoughts?

[Quinn->all]: I appreciate the desire for variety, Jake, and I see your point, Brian, about sticking to what has been consistently good value. I'm drawn to American Flavors USA because of their Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and Smokin' Hot Brisket; those dishes fit my taste for spicy food. The quality and service there have been excellent, and they seem to offer a balance between hearty and healthy options, which is perfect for me. I'm bold enough to try something new, but in this case, I feel that American Flavors USA still has some new flavors for me to explore. Plus, their menu seems to offer a better value for my middle-class budget without sacrificing taste or quality. Let's see if we can come to a consensus in the next round of discussion.

[Jake->all]: I hear both your points about sticking with American Flavors USA, and I can't deny the positive experiences we've had there. My worry about the sodium content in the dishes is something I have to take seriously because of my blood pressure. I'm sure American Flavors USA could accommodate a low sodium version of some dishes, but I'm also tempted by the healthier options like the Caesar Salad with a yogurt-based dressing at Classic American Bistro, which might be naturally lower in sodium. Could we maybe consider if Classic American Bistro would cater to our combined needs for a change, or should we check if American Flavors USA can modify their dishes to suit my dietary restrictions? What do you guys think about giving Classic American Bistro a shot today and seeing if they can match our expectations?

[Brian->all]: Jake and Quinn, I get the points about health and variety. I'm all for new experiences, but I still feel that American Flavors USA is the right choice for us today, especially considering my budget and love for street food. We know that American Flavors USA has been accommodating in the past, and I'm confident they could handle a low sodium request for Jake. Plus, the favorable ratings we've given them suggest that they're doing something right. And Quinn, it sounds like they've got the spicy and hearty dishes you enjoy. If we're talking about value, taste, and past positive experiences, I believe American Flavors USA is still the winner here. How about we go there, and I'll support any low sodium modifications for Jake's health concern? Shall we try for a final decision next round?

[Quinn->all]: I’m leaning towards agreeing with Brian on this one. I've got a penchant for spicy food and American Flavors USA has options that cater to that preference, like the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and Smokin' Hot Brisket. The restaurant has consistently provided us with delicious food and excellent service, which aligns with my bold personality to stick with what I know will satisfy. While I understand the consideration for health with Jake's low sodium needs, I believe that American Flavors USA has shown flexibility in the past and would likely be willing to accommodate such requests. Given our positive past experiences, my middle-class budget, and their diverse menu that offers both hearty and healthier options, I think American Flavors USA is the best choice for us today. Let's consider this as we make our final decision in the next round. What do you say, Jake and Brian?

[Jake->all]: Hey Brian and Quinn, how are you feeling about dinner today? I've been checking out the menus, and while American Flavors USA has been a solid choice for us, I noticed that Classic American Bistro has some new items like the Smashed Avocado Classic Burger and the Superfood Caesar Salad that sound interesting. I'm always up for some fried food, but with my high blood pressure, I should probably look for something with less sodium. What do you guys think?

[Brian]: I'm good with either, Jake. The BBQ Ribs at American Flavors USA are tempting, but I'm also open to trying something new at Classic American Bistro. It's good to change things up sometimes.

[Quinn]: I agree with Brian. It's nice to have variety. Plus, the comments about Classic American Bistro suggest they have fresh ingredients, which is always a plus. But I do love the consistency of American Flavors USA. It's a tough call!

[Jake]: Agreed. The Superfood Caesar Salad at Classic American Bistro could be a healthier option for me. But I also see that American Flavors USA has a Seasonal Harvest Salad and a Zesty Black Bean Burger that might fit my dietary needs. Plus, their customer score is higher, and we've had good experiences there.

[Brian]: True, American Flavors USA does seem to have a better score and we know they are good with dietary needs. Quinn, what's your take?

[Quinn]: Well, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA because of our past experiences, but I wouldn't mind trying the Garden Harvest Veggie Burger at Classic American Bistro. However, considering Jake's health, maybe sticking to a place we know caters well to dietary restrictions is the safer bet.

[Jake]: I appreciate that, Quinn. Let's meet up tomorrow and decide then. We can sleep on it and see if we feel like trying something new or sticking with what we know is good. Sound good?

[Brian]: Sounds like a plan. Catch you both tomorrow!

[Quinn]: See you tomorrow!

[Brian->all]: Hey guys, I've been giving it some thought, and I think we should consider our previous experiences and the health aspects Jake mentioned. American Flavors USA has been consistent in providing us with flavorful and healthier options. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Seasonal Harvest Salad seem like they could be great choices for a healthier meal that still packs a lot of taste.

While I'm all for trying new things, and the Classic American Bistro's menu items like the Smashed Avocado Classic Burger do sound appetizing, the overall customer score and our own past experiences lean in favor of American Flavors USA. Plus, we've been pretty happy with their service, and they seem to accommodate different dietary needs well.

But we should all be comfortable with the final decision, so what do you both think?

[Quinn->all]: I've been thinking about this too, Brian. The bold flavors at American Flavors USA have always been spot-on for my taste, and I'm particularly interested in trying the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and the Smokin' Hot Brisket because I enjoy spicy food. Given my healthy status, I'm not too concerned about the health aspect, but it's good to know they have healthier options as well.

Jake, I understand your need for lower sodium options due to your health, and it seems like American Flavors USA has been able to provide us with healthier dishes in the past. Brian, I get the appeal of trying new things at Classic American Bistro, but I think the consistency and higher customer score at American Flavors USA make it a safer choice for all our needs.

If we're all in agreement, I think we should go with American Flavors USA this time around. We can always try Classic American Bistro another time when we're feeling more adventurous. How does that sound to you both?

[Jake->all]: You both make great points. I've been thinking about it too, and even though the new menu items at Classic American Bistro are tempting, I must consider my high blood pressure and the need for low sodium options. American Flavors USA has consistently provided dishes that meet my dietary restrictions and still taste great. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Seasonal Harvest Salad seem like they would be right up my alley without compromising my health.

I also can't ignore our positive experiences at American Flavors USA. That definitely adds to the comfort level of knowing what to expect. So, I'm in agreement with you both. Let's stick with what we know and enjoy at American Flavors USA. We can try the other restaurant another time when we're not as concerned about specific dietary needs. Shall we go ahead and make this our final decision?

[Jake->all]: The Zesty Black Bean Burger was really good, the flavors were well balanced and it wasn't too salty, which is great for my diet. The Seasonal Harvest Salad was fresh and the dressing had just the right amount of sweetness. I'd give both an 8 out of 10. The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were a hit too, loved the spice level, a solid 8. The Smokin' Hot Brisket and BBQ Ribs were tasty, but not as standout as the others, so 7 for both.

[Brian]: I enjoyed everything tonight, but the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were my favorite. They had a nice kick and the chicken was cooked perfectly, a 9 for me. The Smokin' Hot Brisket was tender and flavorful, so that's an 8. The BBQ Ribs were good, but I've had better, so I'm giving them a 7. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was surprisingly satisfying for a veggie option, an 8. The salad was good, nothing spectacular, a 7.

[Quinn]: I really liked the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers - they were the star for me, so I'm giving them a 9. The BBQ Ribs and the Smokin' Hot Brisket were both delicious. I'd say they were an 8, as they were cooked just right. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was a great vegetarian option that didn't skimp on flavor, I'll give it an 8 too. The Seasonal Harvest Salad was tasty and felt very healthy, so that's a 7 from me.

[Brian->all]: The dishes tonight were all quite satisfying. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was full of flavor, and as someone who enjoys street food, it had a nice homemade feel to it. I'd rate it an 8. The Seasonal Harvest Salad was more than just a side, with a variety of textures and a delightful dressing, so that's a 7 for me. Now, the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers really hit the spot with their heat and tenderness, definitely a 9. The Smokin' Hot Brisket was savory and had a great smokiness to it, earning an 8. Lastly, the BBQ Ribs were enjoyable but didn't quite reach the heights of the skewers or brisket, so I'll give them a 7. Overall, a meal that matched my taste for hearty, flavorful food with a resourceful mix of options.

[Jake->all]: Hey Brian and Quinn, after looking at the information for both restaurants, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA. They have a higher customer score, and I've had good experiences there before. Their Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers sound like they'd satisfy my love for fried food. Plus, they seem to have a focus on flavor and health, which suits my need for a low sodium diet due to my high blood pressure. What do you guys think?

[Brian->all]: Hey Jake and Quinn, American Flavors USA does seem like a solid choice again, considering our past experiences and their high customer score. I appreciate their affordable prices, which fits my budget well, and the street food-inspired dishes like the BBQ Ribs and Fried Chicken Basket are right up my alley. Also, I'm always looking for a place that values resourcefulness, offering both tasty and nutritious options. I'm in good health, so no dietary restrictions to worry about. Quinn, what's your take?

[Quinn->all]: Hey Jake and Brian, I'm all for heading to American Flavors USA once more. Their menu has some spicy options like the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers that I'm keen to try, and they're known for their bold flavors, which I always enjoy. I'm healthy and have no dietary restrictions, so I'm quite flexible with the menu choices. I'm also middle class, and their prices seem reasonable for my income. Given that I'm pretty bold, the variety that American Flavors USA offers in terms of innovative dishes speaks to me. Let's see if we can settle on a final decision in the next round of discussion!

[Jake->all]: I'm glad we're all in agreement about heading back to American Flavors USA. Considering our previous positive experiences and the appealing options on their menu, I think it's a great fit for all of us. Brian, I see the BBQ Ribs and Fried Chicken Basket caught your eye, and Quinn, the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers seem like your kind of dish. I'm definitely going for the Zesty Black Bean Burger again. Shall we finalize this in the next round and decide on the full order?

[Brian->all]: I'm on board with choosing American Flavors USA once more. The prices match my budget, the food has been consistently good, and I'm curious to try some of the dishes we haven't had yet. The BBQ Ribs and Fried Chicken Basket definitely appeal to my taste for street food, and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp also sounds enticing. Jake's suggestion of the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Quinn's interest in the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers are great picks too. How about we add a few more dishes to round out our meal and cater to our diverse tastes? Then we can finalize our decision in the next round. What do you guys think?

[Jake->all]: The meal at American Flavors USA was quite satisfying! The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were deliciously seasoned, and the Zesty Black Bean Burger was as good as I remember. I'd rate them an 8 out of 10 for sure. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp had a nice kick to it as well. I felt the options were well-suited to my dietary needs, and the flavors were bold without being too salty. The New York Cheesecake was a pleasant way to finish the meal, not too sweet and quite creamy. Overall, I'm happy with our choices and the food quality.

[Brian->all]: I have to say, American Flavors USA did a great job again. The BBQ Ribs were perfectly smoked, and the Fried Chicken Basket had that home-cooked comfort feel without being too greasy, which I loved. I'd give both an 8 out of 10. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was flavorful, and the New York Cheesecake was a nice touch, not overly rich but just right. It's great when a place manages to combine the essence of street food with a touch of health consciousness. Good choice, folks!

[Quinn->all]: The dishes we ordered from American Flavors USA were all quite enjoyable. Those Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were just what I was looking for in terms of heat and flavor - they get an 8 from me. The Zesty Black Bean Burger had a nice balance of zest and texture, so I'd also rate it an 8. The New York Cheesecake was surprisingly light and not too sweet, which was perfect after the meal. The overall experience was great, and I'm pleased with the variety and quality of food we got for the price. It's nice when a restaurant consistently delivers on taste and quality. Solid 8 across the board for me.

I love fried food, but I've got to watch my sodium intake because of my high blood pressure. American Flavors USA has been consistently good for us, especially on the health-conscious side of things.

[Jake->all]: Guys, I was really happy with our choices today. The BBQ Ribs were tender and had the right balance of smokiness and sweetness - a solid good for me. The Cobb Salad was fresh and the dressing wasn't overpowering, perfect for my health needs. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was a standout with its flavor and texture, and those Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers had just the right kick to satisfy my love for fried food without being too unhealthy. And that Smokin' Hot Brisket, oh boy, it was delectable! I'm giving an 8 for an overall score from my end. What about you, Brian and Quinn?

[Brian->all]: I'm definitely impressed with our meal at American Flavors USA. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was everything I hoped for, with that street food vibe and packed with flavor. The BBQ Ribs were a delightful surprise, and I felt they were a good value for the price. The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were just amazing, offering that spicy punch I crave, while still feeling like a healthier choice. The Cobb Salad was fresh and the Smokin' Hot Brisket was succulent and flavorful. I'm giving an 8 as well, the food quality and service really hit the mark for me today. Quinn, your thoughts?

[Quinn->all]: I'm definitely in agreement with the both of you. American Flavors USA didn't disappoint; the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were my favorite, delivering on the spicy kick I love. The Smokin' Hot Brisket was tender and packed with flavor, living up to my expectations for boldness. The BBQ Ribs had a good balance of spice and smokiness, and even the Cobb Salad, which I don't usually go for, was quite enjoyable with its fresh ingredients. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was a nice vegetarian option that didn't lack in taste. Overall, I'm feeling a solid 8 for the meal. Let's wrap this up and give our final review.

[Jake->all]: Hey team, it's decision time again. Let's look at our options for today. We've been to American Flavors USA quite a bit lately, and it's been generally good, especially with the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers. They've been great at catering to my need for low sodium options, and the food is right up my alley since I love fried food. But I'm noticing the customer scores have dipped slightly, with some comments hinting at a desire for more creativity in flavors. 

On the other hand, we've got the Classic American Bistro, which seems to have some interesting dishes like the American Innovator Burger and the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection. The customer score is lower, but they also have some healthy options like the Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken that might be good for my high blood pressure. Plus, a change of scenery could be nice. What do you all think? Should we give Classic American Bistro a try for a bit of variety, or stick to what we know is good at American Flavors USA?

[Brian->all]: Hey Jake, I'm leaning towards trying out something new today and giving Classic American Bistro a chance. My budget is pretty tight, but looking at the menu, I see a few items that are reasonably priced. The Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl and the Hearty American Beef Stew seem like they would be quite filling and are right up my alley in terms of taste for street food flavors. I'm also curious about the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe, which seems like it could be a good bang for my buck. I'm healthy, with no dietary restrictions, so I'm flexible on that front.

I do appreciate the consistent quality we've been getting at American Flavors USA, but I agree that a bit of a shake-up could be good for us. Plus, I'm resourceful, so I'm all for trying to find the best value for my money, which might be at the Classic American Bistro today. What are your thoughts, Quinn?

[Quinn->all]: Hey Jake and Brian, thanks for your input. I'm also inclined to try out Classic American Bistro today. My budget is comfortable enough to explore their menu, and I'm really drawn to the spicy and bold flavor profiles. The Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl sounds right up my alley, and I'm intrigued by the Smokey BBQ Brisket Sandwich. My taste for spicy food aligns well with these options.

I'm healthy without any dietary restrictions, and my bold personality has me excited to try something new. While American Flavors USA has served us well, the customer scores seem to suggest that their menu is becoming a bit predictable. I think it's time we spice things up a bit and see what Classic American Bistro has to offer. It could be a refreshing change and who knows, we might discover some new favorites. Are we ready to make this shift for today's meal?

[Jake->all]: I'm getting the sense that we're all leaning towards switching it up and trying Classic American Bistro today. The menu has some promising options that could be a good fit for my taste in fried food and my health considerations. I'm particularly interested in trying their Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken, as it seems like a healthier choice that can accommodate my high blood pressure issues. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe also caught my eye since it seems like it could be a flavorful option that's not too heavy on the sodium.

Given our experiences at American Flavors USA, a change could indeed be refreshing. Also, my jovial nature is up for some novelty, and it might be a good opportunity to create some new memories. Since we all seem to be on the same page about giving Classic American Bistro a try, shall we consider making a decision in the next round? Let's think about which dishes we'd like to try and how they fit our individual needs and preferences. Brian, Quinn, any thoughts on the specific dishes you'd want to order?

[Brian->all]: I've given it some thought, and I'm definitely interested in ordering the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl since it's within my budget and seems like it'll be hearty and flavorful, a perfect match for my street food taste. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe also stands out to me as a great value for the price, and I reckon it'll be a satisfying choice. I can't pass up on trying the Classic American Apple Pie as well; it's a street food staple turned gourmet, and it's a reasonable splurge for dessert.

I think these choices should suit me well considering my financial constraints and my preference for tasty, resourceful options. If we're set on Classic American Bistro, which it seems we are, I'd be happy with these dishes. What about you, Quinn? Have you decided on the specific items you'd like to order? And Jake, any final thoughts before we wrap up our decision?

[Quinn->all]: Brian, those choices sound great. I'm definitely going with the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl as well, it seems like it has the bold and spicy profile I enjoy. Additionally, the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe is calling my name; I'm expecting it to be packed with flavor. And for a bit of variety, I'd like to try the Smokey BBQ Brisket Sandwich—it seems like a dish that can stand up to my love for bold tastes.

For a sweet ending, the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait seems like a light and refreshing option to balance out the meal. It's within my budget and health-conscious too. I'm all about taking chances and trying new things, so this new restaurant could be a hit for us. If we're all in agreement, let's finalize our decision in the next round. Jake, any particular dishes from Classic American Bistro you want to make sure we include?

[Jake->all]: Alright, folks, I'd say today's meal was quite the success! Everything we chose hit that good range. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe was a highlight for me, with a nice balance of flavors that didn't overwhelm my need for low sodium. The Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken was tender and flavorful, which is exactly what I was looking for. I'd give each dish a solid 7.8, rounding up to an 8 for the effort. It's refreshing to see that our little adventure to a new place paid off. What do you think, Brian? How did the dishes fare for you?

[Brian->all]: The meal at Classic American Bistro really lived up to my expectations. The Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl was hearty and packed with the street food flavors I love, so I'd give it a 7.8 as well. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe was delicious and a great value for the price, another 7.8 from me. And the Classic American Apple Pie was the perfect end to the meal, with its flaky crust and cinnamon-spiced apple filling, a definite 7.8. Overall, I'm happy with our choice to switch things up today. What about you, Quinn? How'd the meal stack up for you?

[Quinn->all]: The Classic American Bistro really hit the spot today! The Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl was right on target with its spicy kick, earning a 7.8 from me. The Smokey BBQ Brisket Sandwich was another win, with bold flavors that lived up to my expectations, also a 7.8. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe was just as satisfying, and the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait was a delightful way to round off the meal, both deserving of a 7.8. I'm feeling pretty content with our decision to try something new. It's been a good dining experience. Let's round up those scores and finalize our group review. Who's up for summarizing?

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, we've had a great run with American Flavors USA, but I noticed that our scores for it dipped a bit recently. I'm curious about Classic American Bistro since we had a good experience there on Day 12. I love fried food, but I have to watch out for my blood pressure and keep the sodium low. What's everyone's take on where we should eat today?

[Brian->all]: Hey Jake, I hear you on the recent dip with American Flavors USA. I'm a big fan of street food, and both places have some appealing options. I'm leaning towards Classic American Bistro today, as the Freedom Trail Chili and the Bald Eagle Beef Dip sound like they have that hearty, street food vibe but with a unique twist. Plus, our last experience there was pretty solid. What do you think, Quinn?

[Quinn->all]: Hi Jake and Brian, I'm glad we're exploring our options. While I've enjoyed the meals at American Flavors USA, I do think it's time to switch things up given the slight decrease in our satisfaction levels. The Classic American Bistro's menu is tempting, especially with items like the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe and the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection. They both have that bold, spicy flavor profile I crave, and it seems like they could be a good fit for my taste and health-conscious lifestyle. Let's see if we can find a nice balance of flavors that also aligns with our dietary needs. What do you think about giving Classic American Bistro another shot and selecting some dishes that satisfy our different tastes and health considerations?

[Jake->all]: I appreciate both of your input. Trying out Classic American Bistro again sounds like a good plan. We should consider dishes that are tasty but also meet our health requirements. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe might be a bit on the heavier side for me in terms of sodium because of the BBQ sauce, but the Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken could be a healthier choice with its quinoa and roasted vegetable salad. Plus, the avocado in the The American Innovator Burger could offer some heart-healthy fats. I'm definitely up for giving Classic American Bistro another try if we can choose dishes that are suitable for everyone. Brian, Quinn, shall we consider these options or any others you might find suitable?

[Brian->all]: Sounds good, Jake. The Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken does look like a healthier option, and I'm all for the American Innovator Burger – it's got that classic street food feel with a gourmet touch. I think we should also consider the Freedom Trail Chili; it has that hearty aspect that I love in street food. Quinn, do you think these choices would work for you? We could probably balance it out with something like the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait for a lighter, healthier dessert to end the meal. What do you say?

[Quinn->all]: The dishes you've both suggested from Classic American Bistro sound great. The Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken is a healthy choice that should cater well to Jake's need to watch his sodium intake, and the American Innovator Burger with its avocado is a tempting option for some healthier fats. I'm particularly excited about the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection because it has that bold flavor I love. The Freedom Trail Chili also seems like a flavorful and satisfying choice, Brian. And ending with the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait offers that lighter touch to balance our meal. I'd say we have a good selection that meets our diverse requirements. If you both agree, I think we're ready to make this our final decision. Shall we go ahead and formalize our choices?

[Jake->all]: That meal was solid all around. Each dish was good with the flavors well-executed. The American Innovator Burger had a nice balance with the avocado, which is great for my diet. The Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken was spot on for my health needs, and I'd give a score of 8 for both. The Freedom Trail Chili and Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection were hearty and delicious without being too heavy on salt. The Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait was a delightful finish. I'd rate each of them an 8 as well. What do you guys think?

[Brian->all]: I'm with you, Jake. The meal hit the right spot for me with that street food appeal, especially the Freedom Trail Chili which was hearty and flavorful. The American Innovator Burger was top-notch, and I enjoyed the bold flavors of the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection. The Berry Parfait ended things on a lighter note, which I appreciated. I'd happily give a solid 8 to all the dishes we had. They were all good, and the service was great, too. How about you, Quinn? What are your thoughts on our meal?

[Quinn->all]: The dinner at Classic American Bistro was quite satisfying. The American Innovator Burger's avocado provided a creamy contrast that I enjoyed, and the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection had that spicy kick I'm always after. The Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken was perfectly seasoned, and the Freedom Trail Chili added a comforting warmth to the meal. The Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait was a refreshing end to our dinner. Overall, I would give each dish an 8 for their good flavor and how they catered to our health and taste preferences. It seems we're all in agreement on the quality of the meal. Shall we move on to summarizing our experience?

[Jake->all]: Sure, our meal at Classic American Bistro was very satisfactory. The dishes were all cooked well and the flavors were balanced, which is great considering our different tastes and health considerations. I'm with you all on the scores as well. I think we can say that the consistency across all dishes was notable, and it's impressive that they've maintained good quality without compromising on taste or healthiness. I'm ready for us to summarize our experience if everyone else is too. Shall I take the lead on the final summary?

[Brian->all]: Absolutely, Jake. I think we're all on the same page with our scores, so go ahead and summarize our experience. I'm looking forward to seeing our collective thoughts come together in the final review.

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, I'm leaning towards Classic American Bistro today. Their menu options seem to have some great choices that could fit our health needs, like the Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken and Freedom Trail Chili that seem hearty yet not too heavy on sodium. Plus, the comments from other diners suggest they're doing a great job with flavors and health-conscious options. What do you all think?

[Brian]: I'm open to trying Classic American Bistro again. That Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature sounds really tempting, and it's by Chef Ramsey! I think it's worth a shot, especially since we've been to American Flavors USA quite a bit lately.

[Quinn]: I agree with both of you. Classic American Bistro seems like a solid choice, and it's good to mix things up. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe caught my eye – it sounds delicious. But Jake, how do you feel about the sodium content in these dishes? We should keep your health in mind.

[Jake]: Thanks for considering that, Quinn. I'd probably steer clear of the heavier sauces and ask for any dressings on the side to keep the sodium in check. The roasted chicken and chili should be safe bets, and I can always double-check with the server to make adjustments.

[Brian]: Sounds like a plan. So, should we go for the Classic American Bistro and pick dishes that can be made with less sodium?

[Quinn]: I'm all in for that. Let's do it. Jake, since you have dietary restrictions, you should lead the charge on selecting the dishes. 

[Jake]: Got it. I'll make sure to choose wisely for us all. Let's finalize this in the next round.

[Brian]: Agreed, let's lock it down next.

    "summary": "After discussing with Jake and Quinn, we've decided to go for Classic American Bistro. The decision was influenced by the desire to have a varied dining experience since we've frequented American Flavors USA quite a bit. We considered health-conscious options and the ability to adjust dishes to lower their sodium content, which aligns with Jake's dietary needs. The Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature particularly appealed to me, considering it's a Chef Ramsey creation. Quinn was interested in the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe, and we all agreed on the other dishes for their balance of flavor and health considerations."

[Jake->all]: I'm quite satisfied with the meal. The Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken had a nice tangy flavor without being too salty, which is great for my blood pressure. The Freedom Trail Chili was hearty and seemed to be a good low-sodium option. I'd give a solid 8 to all the dishes.

[Brian]: I have to say, everything was on point for me. The Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature lived up to my expectations – Chef Ramsey's touch was evident. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe was also a hit. I'm happy with the choices. All dishes get an 8.

[Quinn]: The flavors were really well-balanced, and I appreciate the attention to health. The pulled pork was delicious, and the beef stew was comforting. I agree with Jake and Brian, an 8 for each dish seems fair.

[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.
    ],
    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, I've been looking over both menus, and considering my high blood pressure and low sodium diet, I think the Classic American Bistro might be a good choice for us tonight. They have dishes like the Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken and the Hearty Colonial Beef Stew that seem to be flavorful without relying too heavily on salt. Plus, their overall customer score is pretty solid. What do you all think?

[Brian]: I see where you're coming from Jake, and I agree that Classic American Bistro seems to offer balanced flavors. However, I'm also tempted by the Bold American Bison Burger they're advertising – sounds like a tasty adventure! Still, health-wise, your choice makes sense.

[Quinn]: I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA. I've really enjoyed their Spicy Black Bean Burger and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp in the past. Plus, their Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl could be a good low-sodium option for you, Jake. They've been pretty consistent with their quality.

[Jake]: That's a fair point, Quinn. I did enjoy the Spicy Black Bean Burger, but I'm just a bit concerned about the salt content with those spicier options. I'm still more inclined to go with Classic American Bistro tonight.

[Brian]: After thinking it over, I'm okay with giving Classic American Bistro a shot. It's important that we all find something suitable for our health needs.

[Quinn]: Well, if both of you are leaning towards Classic American Bistro, and they have dishes that can accommodate our diets, I'm on board too. Let's do it.

[Jake]: Great! Let's finalize our decision in the next round then.
