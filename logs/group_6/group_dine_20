[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Max->all]: Given my income level, which is quite low, and my preference for plant-based meals due to my taste and the fact that I am in good health with no dietary restrictions, I would like to suggest a restaurant that offers a meal that fits both my budget and dietary preferences. Since my personality is resourceful, I would also look for a restaurant that provides the best value for money.

Looking at the menus of both "Classic American Bistro" and "American Flavors USA," I notice that "Classic American Bistro" has a Caesar Salad which can be made plant-based if the parmesan and dressing are omitted, and "American Flavors USA" offers a Cobb Salad, which typically contains chicken and eggs but could be modified to be plant-based by asking to exclude these ingredients and the blue cheese.

While both restaurants focus on American cuisine and have similar dishes, "American Flavors USA" seems to have slightly lower prices, which would be more suitable for my budget. However, the plant-based options are limited at both restaurants.

Before making a final decision, I would like to hear other members' opinions on which restaurant might accommodate a plant-based diet better and whether they consider the price difference significant enough to influence our choice.

[Sam->all]: Considering my financial constraints with an income of $5,500, which is not very high, I'm inclined to look for a restaurant that offers hearty, home-style cooking that's both affordable and satisfying. Health-wise, I'm in good shape with no dietary restrictions, so I have flexibility in what I can eat. My warm personality gravitates towards places that have a friendly atmosphere and where the food reminds me of home.

Between "Classic American Bistro" and "American Flavors USA," I notice that "American Flavors USA" offers more budget-friendly options. For instance, their BBQ Ribs are priced at $18 compared to the $25 at Classic American Bistro, and the Classic American Burger is $12, which is $3 less than the Classic Cheeseburger at Classic American Bistro.

Additionally, American Flavors USA seems to offer hearty portions which would appeal to my taste for home cooking. The Fried Chicken Basket and the Mac & Cheese are dishes that resonate with my preferences for comfort food.

While I appreciate Max's need for a plant-based meal and the value aspect he's looking for, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA because of the slightly lower prices and the menu items that fit my taste for comforting, familiar foods. I would be interested to hear what the other members think and whether they have a preference based on their own needs and tastes.

[Max->all]: Sam, I appreciate your insights and understand your preference for comfort food and value, which align with my own need for affordability. It's good to know that "American Flavors USA" also appeals to you because of their hearty portions and lower prices. I believe we're both considering our budgets carefully.

I'd like us to also consider the service aspect. While the menus provide some indication of what we might expect in terms of food, we do not have direct information about the quality of service at either restaurant. However, we can perhaps infer that the restaurant with more attention to detail in their menu descriptions might also place a higher emphasis on customer service. On that note, "Classic American Bistro" describes their dishes more elaborately, which could suggest a better dining experience overall.

I'm open to considering "American Flavors USA" if they can accommodate a plant-based version of their Cobb Salad, as this would meet my dietary preference and budget. However, I'm still interested in hearing from other members to see if their preferences align with ours or if they have different considerations that might affect our final decision.

[Sam->all]: I'm in agreement with Max's point about the detail in the menu descriptions potentially reflecting the level of service. Classic American Bistro's menu is indeed described with more flair, which might indicate a higher quality of service. However, as my priority leans more towards finding delicious home-style cooking that fits within my budget, American Flavors USA is still more appealing to me due to its slightly lower prices and dishes that remind me of home.

Moreover, it seems that American Flavors USA could potentially cater to Max's plant-based diet with some modifications to their Cobb Salad. Given both our preferences for value and my inclination towards dishes that resemble home cooking, I'm leaning towards choosing "American Flavors USA." It would be wonderful if they can customize the Cobb Salad to be plant-based for Max, and the Fried Chicken Basket and Mac & Cheese resonate with my taste for comfort food.

Since we both are looking at the price and hearty portions, and given that the service aspect is somewhat speculative without customer scores or comments to guide us, I propose that we select "American Flavors USA" for our meal. However, I am open to further discussion and would like to reach a consensus that satisfies all members' preferences and needs.

The decision was influenced by the restaurant's slightly lower prices, which are more suitable for our budgets, and the potential for hearty portions. Sam expressed a strong preference for comfort food, which this restaurant appears to offer with dishes like the Fried Chicken Basket and Mac & Cheese. Max, with a preference for plant-based meals, noted that a modified Cobb Salad could meet his dietary needs. The service quality is uncertain for both establishments, but it was considered less of a priority than the menu offerings and prices. We came to a consensus that American Flavors USA would best accommodate our combined preferences for budget-friendly, hearty, and customizable meals."

[Max->all]: The modified Cobb Salad, which was prepared plant-based, was quite refreshing, though it lacked the protein component I usually look for in a plant-based meal. I would rate it a 6 out of 10, considering it was accommodating but not exceptional. The Fried Chicken Basket and Mac & Cheese were fair, though not particularly remarkable, with a score of 5.6 from me. They met expectations but did not exceed them. I'd be curious to hear Sam's thoughts on these dishes.

[Sam->all]: The Fried Chicken Basket was a decent effort at home-style comfort food. The chicken was cooked through but lacked the seasoning to elevate it. It tasted quite average, hence the 5.6 score seems fitting. Similarly, the Mac & Cheese was comforting but didn't stand out in flavor or texture; I'd agree with the given score of 5.6. Overall, my individual scores for both dishes would align with the reference scores, marking them as fair. I'm interested to see if our collective experience will lead us to the same conclusion or if there are differing opinions that could affect our final score.

[Max->all]: Reflecting on the meal at American Flavors USA, the modified Cobb Salad was satisfactory in terms of accommodating a plant-based diet, but as Max mentioned, it did lack a significant protein element. Therefore, I'd agree with his score of 6 out of 10. The Fried Chicken Basket and Mac & Cheese had fair scores, and I concur with the assessment that both dishes were average with no distinct qualities to make them stand out. My scores would also be a 5.6 for both dishes. They were edible and decent but not impressive. It seems like our experiences were quite aligned, and I'm ready to move on to summarizing our discussion in the final review.

[Sam->all]: {
    "restaurant": "American Flavors USA",

        "Max": 6,

[Max->all]: Hey team, considering my preference for plant-based meals and looking at both menus, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA because they offer a Zesty Black Bean Burger which fits my taste and dietary choices. Even though the customer score is slightly lower, it seems like a better fit for me personally. What do you all think?

[Sam->all]: Well, I value home cooking and I'm on a very tight budget, so the prices at American Flavors USA are more appealing to me. Their menu has comfort food like the Fried Chicken Basket and the Mac & Cheese, which I'm sure I would love. Plus, I like the idea of trying their New York Cheesecake with the berry compote topping. So, I'm inclined to agree with Max about American Flavors USA. How about you guys? What are your thoughts?

[Max->all]: I've been looking for dishes that could meet my health-conscious choices, and I noticed that Classic American Bistro has a Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon that seems to fit the bill. It's paired with organic seasonal vegetables, which is a plus for me. However, I also see the merit in what Max and Sam are saying about American Flavors USA, particularly regarding the plant-based options and budget-friendly prices. I could consider their Zesty Black Bean Burger as a healthier choice too. I guess I'm a bit torn between the two, but I'm open to further discussion to reach a consensus. What are your preferences and how do they align with the options at these restaurants?

[Sam->all]: Given that I'm looking for a meal that feels like home cooking, is affordable on my very limited budget, and since I'm in good health with no dietary restrictions, American Flavors USA still seems like the best choice for me. Their menu offers comfort food options that I'm fond of, and I'm particularly interested in the Fried Chicken Basket and Mac & Cheese, which I think will give me that homey feel I'm after. I also agree with Max that the Zesty Black Bean Burger could be a tempting choice, even though I don't have any dietary restrictions. It's always nice to try something different, and a black bean burger sounds like a healthy yet satisfying option.

I understand the appeal of the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon at Classic American Bistro, especially for someone looking for a healthier dish with vegetables. However, considering my budget and taste preferences, I'm still leaning towards American Flavors USA. They seem to offer the best value for money, which is very important to me, and I'm intrigued by the berry compote on their New York Cheesecake as well.

Can we all consider these points and maybe find a dish at American Flavors USA that satisfies everyone's needs? What do you all think? Shall we give it a try?

[Max->all]: I hear what everyone is saying, and I'm glad to see there's some common ground. While I do have a preference for plant-based meals for health and taste reasons, I recognize that we're looking for a place that suits all of our preferences and budgets. American Flavors USA does seem to offer a good variety that could cater to us all, including comfort food for Sam and the Zesty Black Bean Burger for myself. 

Considering the budget and our health-conscious approach, it seems that the options at American Flavors USA may provide us with a balance between cost and healthier choices. The Zesty Black Bean Burger appears to be a good pick for a healthier, plant-based meal that aligns with my preferences. Plus, Sam's choices of the Fried Chicken Basket and Mac & Cheese seem to be in line with his desire for comfort food that's within budget.

Let's consider the service and flavors as well. Although the customer score is slightly lower at American Flavors USA, the comments suggest that the food meets basic expectations and the service was accommodating. While not exceptional, it could be a solid choice for a satisfying meal that doesn't break the bank.

I'm still open to suggestions, but I'm leaning more towards American Flavors USA for its variety and value. What do you all think? If we're all in agreement, we could move towards a final decision in the next round.

[Sam->all]: Based on our discussion, it seems we've found some common ground with American Flavors USA. The restaurant offers both the comfort food that I'm looking for and the healthier, plant-based options that Max is interested in, all at reasonable prices that are important for my budget.

Max has expressed interest in the Zesty Black Bean Burger, which is a healthier choice and aligns with his plant-based preference. I'm excited about the Fried Chicken Basket and Mac & Cheese, which speak to my love for home cooking. Plus, the New York Cheesecake with berry compote topping is a dessert that I'm quite eager to try.

Even though the customer score is a bit lower for American Flavors USA, the comments indicate that the service is accommodating and the food is satisfactory. We all seem to be leaning towards American Flavors USA because it offers a balance of flavors, healthier options, and good value for money.

If we're all in agreement, then I think we're ready to make a final decision in the next round. What do you say, team? Shall we finalize our choice and pick our dishes from American Flavors USA?

[Max->all]: Based on my experience from the previous visits and my personal preference for plant-based meals, I would lean more towards American Flavors USA. They have a Zesty Black Bean Burger that aligns with my plant-based diet, and it seems like the overall experience there has been improving, considering our Day 2 experience scored an 8. I'm healthy and don't have dietary restrictions, but I do prefer to have a meal that's both satisfying and not too heavy. The service at American Flavors USA also has been noted as commendable, which is important to me. What are everyone else's thoughts?

[Sam->all]: Considering my financial situation, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA as well. They seem to offer hearty, home-cooked-style meals which I personally enjoy, and their dishes are more within my budget. I don't have any dietary restrictions, and I'm healthy, so I'm open to a variety of options. The Cobb Salad with extra zest and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken caught my eye for being flavorful yet not too pricey. I'm also a fan of warm service, which seems to be a highlight at American Flavors USA according to recent feedback. I'd be interested to hear if anyone else has any opinions or preferences before we make a final decision.

[Max->all]: Given our previous experiences and the menu options, I'm also in favor of American Flavors USA. Their menu offers a good variety of dishes that seem to cater to our tastes and the service has been positively reviewed. Since I have a taste for plant-based meals, the Zesty Black Bean Burger is particularly appealing to me and it's great to see that the restaurant provides options that accommodate different dietary preferences. Also, considering the budget-friendly prices and the fact that we've had a good experience on Day 2 with a score of 8, it seems like a sensible choice. How does everyone feel about choosing American Flavors USA and trying out some of their dishes that we haven't yet had the chance to taste?

[Sam->all]: I agree with both of you. American Flavors USA has caught my attention not only because of the budget-friendly options that suit my income level but also because of the positive feedback on the service and the variety in their menu. The home-cooked-style meals like the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken seem like they would satisfy my preference for heartwarming dishes. Plus, I think the warm service mentioned in the comments will make the dining experience even more enjoyable for me. I'm all for giving American Flavors USA another try and sampling some different dishes from their menu. If we're good with this decision, we could move forward and select our dishes for the meal. Shall we proceed?

[Max->all]: Given my preference for plant-based meals and the fact that I've already had a positive experience with American Flavors USA, I'm inclined to lean towards dining there again. Their Zesty Black Bean Burger was particularly impressive and aligns with my taste for plant-based options. The previous comments and experiences suggest that the food at American Flavors USA has been consistently flavorful and the service has been commendable.

However, I'm open to considering Classic American Bistro if there are compelling reasons to do so. I noticed that they offer a Lean Bison Burger which could be a healthier meat option, but it doesn't cater to my plant-based preference. Their customer score is lower, and the comments indicate that while satisfactory, their dishes may lack the exceptional quality we've found at American Flavors USA.

I'd like to hear your thoughts and preferences, especially regarding any specific dietary needs or desires for this meal. Shall we start by sharing our individual needs and then move towards finding a consensus?

[Sam->all]: I appreciate your insights, Max. Considering my own preferences for home cooking and the fact that I have a very limited budget, I'm also leaning towards American Flavors USA. Their menu items like the Fried Chicken Basket and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken appeal to my taste for comfort dishes, and their prices seem more in line with my financial constraints.

The positive experiences we've had there in the past with both food and service carry a lot of weight in my decision. While I'm curious about the offerings at Classic American Bistro, especially the American Dream Burger, the consistent feedback about the lack of exceptional qualities does not compel me to change venues, especially when on a tight budget.

I'm healthy and have no dietary restrictions, so my focus is more on getting a satisfying meal that brings a sense of home to the table. I'm all for warmth and familiarity in my dining experience, which I feel American Flavors USA has provided us with so far. Let's continue the discussion and see if we can reach a consensus.

[Max->all]: It seems we're both in agreement about leaning towards American Flavors USA. The restaurant not only fits within our budget but also caters to our tastes. I appreciate the plant-based options they provide, which fits perfectly with my dietary preferences. Their Zesty Black Bean Burger was a highlight for me, and I would be happy to have it again.

Sam, I understand your preference for comfort dishes and the financial constraints you're considering. It's great that American Flavors USA also has offerings that appeal to you, like the Fried Chicken Basket and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, providing both satisfaction and affordability.

Considering our combined experiences and preferences, I feel confident that American Flavors USA would be the right choice for our next dining experience. We should also consider ordering a variety of dishes to share, to cater to our different tastes and provide a communal dining experience.

If we're all in agreement, we can move forward in the next round and make a final decision. Shall we proceed?

[Sam->all]: Absolutely, Max. It's great that we've found common ground in our preferences and budget considerations. American Flavors USA has consistently delivered a combination of taste and value that suits us both. I'm more than happy to partake in the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken again, and I'm eager to try the Fried Chicken Basket, which sounds like it would hit the spot for my love of home-style cooking.

I also agree with the idea of ordering a variety of dishes. It not only allows us to enjoy our personal favorites but also gives us an opportunity to try something new from their menu, enhancing our dining experience with a shared approach.

Given our discussions and the alignment of our needs and preferences, I'm ready to move to the next round and make our final decision on dining at American Flavors USA. Let's finalize our choices in terms of the dishes we want to order in the next round of our discussion.

[Max->all]: The Zesty Black Bean Burger was as good as I remembered, a solid choice for anyone looking for a plant-based meal that doesn't sacrifice flavor. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken had a delightful sweet and savory balance that was quite satisfying. The Fried Chicken Basket had a homey feel to it, very comforting. The Cobb Salad was a fresh and flavorful side that complemented the main dishes well. Lastly, the New York Cheesecake was creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness. I'd rate the Black Bean Burger and Bourbon Chicken both at an 8, the Fried Chicken Basket at an 8 as well, the Cobb Salad at a 7, and the Cheesecake at a 7.

[Sam->all]: The Zesty Black Bean Burger certainly lived up to my expectations; it was hearty and packed with flavor. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was a highlight for me, with its perfect glaze and tender meat. The Fried Chicken Basket reminded me of a home-cooked meal, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The Cobb Salad was a nice, lighter complement to the meal, and the New York Cheesecake was a delightful finish with its rich texture and berry compote. My scores would be: Black Bean Burger - 8, Bourbon Chicken - 8, Fried Chicken Basket - 8, Cobb Salad - 7, and Cheesecake - 7.

[Max->all]: Reflecting on our meal at American Flavors USA, I'm pleased with our choices. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was delicious and satisfying for a plant-based option. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was well-executed with a nice balance of flavors. The Fried Chicken Basket was comfort food at its best, tasty and fulfilling. The Cobb Salad provided a fresh and zesty contrast to the meal, and the New York Cheesecake ended things on a sweet note. Here are my scores: Black Bean Burger - 8, Bourbon Chicken - 8, Fried Chicken Basket - 8, Cobb Salad - 7, Cheesecake - 7.

[Sam->all]: The meal at American Flavors USA was truly satisfying. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was hearty, with a good balance of spices and textures, deserving an 8 for its robust plant-based flavors. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken stood out with its sweet and savory glaze, earning itself an 8 for its tender and flavorful profile. The Fried Chicken Basket hit the spot with its home-style taste, also an 8 for its comforting essence. The Cobb Salad was a fresh and zesty accompaniment, a solid 7 for its crisp ingredients and dressing. Lastly, the New York Cheesecake was indulgent without being overly sweet, a well-earned 7 for its creamy richness. Overall, I'd rate the dining experience highly, with the dishes meeting my expectations for flavor, comfort, and quality.

[Max->all]: After reviewing both restaurants' menus and considering our previous experiences, I believe we should give Classic American Bistro a try today. While American Flavors USA has consistently offered us great meals, with a particular highlight on the Zesty Black Bean Burger, I think it's important for us to explore new options. Classic American Bistro's Heartland Veggie Burger caught my eye as a plant-based option that could offer a new flavor experience. The updated Caesar Salad with a lighter dressing might also be a refreshing choice. Despite the average customer score, I'm curious to see if their recent menu additions have improved the dining experience, and I think our group might be pleasantly surprised. What do you all think?

[Sam->all]: I'm open to trying Classic American Bistro, Max. I like the idea of exploring new flavors, and since we've been to American Flavors USA a few times already, it could be refreshing to change it up. The Heartland Veggie Burger seems like a hearty, home-style option that aligns with my taste preference, and the Harvest Chicken Salad might be a healthy, flavorful choice. Plus, I'm intrigued by the gluten-free New York Cheesecake; it sounds like a nice treat that fits within a healthier diet. Let's see if Classic American Bistro's service and food have improved as their advertisement suggests. Shall we see what others think before we make a final decision?

[Max->all]: I agree with both of you, Sam and Max. It's always good to explore new places, and the Heartland Veggie Burger at Classic American Bistro has definitely piqued my interest as a plant-based meal option. Additionally, the healthier twist on the Caesar Salad seems like a great complement to the burger. Although American Flavors USA has been a solid choice in the past, I'm looking forward to trying something different. The Classic American Bistro's menu options look promising, and even though their customer score isn't as high, I believe we shouldn't judge solely on that. Everyone's taste is different, and we might find a new favorite dish there. Let's hear the rest of the group's opinions and then decide together.

[Sam->all]: I'm with you on giving Classic American Bistro a chance. It's good to mix things up, and their menu has a couple of items that I find appealing. The Heartland Veggie Burger seems like a comforting and familiar choice, staying true to my preference for home cooking. The Harvest Chicken Salad could be a good balance, offering a healthier option without compromising on taste. And I must admit, the gluten-free New York Cheesecake is quite tempting as a dessert. I'm keen to see if Classic American Bistro's service matches up to their food, and I hope they live up to the potential shown in their menu and advertisement. Looking forward to hearing from the rest of the group and reaching a consensus.

[Max->all]: I'm glad to see we're considering Classic American Bistro for our dining experience today. I was initially drawn to their Heartland Veggie Burger, which sounds like a tasty plant-based option that aligns with my dietary preferences. The lighter take on the Caesar Salad could be a nice, health-conscious starter, and I'm also curious about the gluten-free New York Cheesecake, which could be a delightful end to the meal. Given that we've had several meals at American Flavors USA and have enjoyed them, I think it's time to explore and find new favorites. I appreciate the adventurous spirit and am eager to try out Classic American Bistro to see if they've stepped up their game in both service and culinary creativity. Let's see if the rest of the group is ready to decide or if there are any further thoughts.

[Max->all]: The Heartland Veggie Burger was decent, offering a nice variety of textures with the black beans, sweet corn, and fresh herbs. However, I felt it could have used a bit more spice to really elevate the flavors. The Caesar Salad was a good attempt at a lighter option, but it didn't stand out in any significant way. I appreciated the effort to make the New York Cheesecake gluten-free, and it was a fair dessert, although not particularly memorable. Overall, my experience was satisfactory, but there's definitely room for improvement in terms of flavor depth and creativity. I'd give each dish a 6 out of 10, which aligns with the fair score they received.

[Sam->all]: The Heartland Veggie Burger was quite satisfying with its home-style cooking feel, though it could have benefited from a bit more seasoning. The Caesar Salad was refreshing and the Harvest Chicken Salad was a healthy choice that tasted good, but neither were particularly outstanding. The New York Cheesecake was enjoyable, especially considering it was gluten-free, and it's always nice to have dessert options that cater to different dietary needs. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon and Apple Pie a la Mode were both fair, but I expected a little more excitement in terms of flavor. The American Dream Burger and Mac & Cheese were comforting, yet they didn't quite hit that 'wow' factor I was looking for. I would rate each dish a 6 out of 10 as well, which seems to be a fair assessment given my experience.

[Max->all]: The dishes at Classic American Bistro were generally satisfactory. The Heartland Veggie Burger had a nice mix of ingredients and was a decent plant-based option, but it could have been more flavorful. The Caesar Salad was a light starter, and while the yogurt-based Caesar dressing was tangy, it didn't bring anything extraordinary to the dish. The New York Cheesecake's gluten-free aspect is commendable, but the taste was just fair. The other dishes, including the Harvest Chicken Salad, Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon, Apple Pie a la Mode, The American Dream Burger, and Mac & Cheese, were enjoyable but not exceptional. They all met our expectations without exceeding them. I would rate each dish as a 6 out of 10, reflecting their fair scores and the overall average experience we had at the restaurant.

[Sam->all]: The meal at Classic American Bistro was overall quite decent, but none of the dishes truly impressed me. The Heartland Veggie Burger had a good texture but lacked a kick of flavor that I was hoping for. The Caesar Salad and Harvest Chicken Salad were fresh and well-prepared but didn't stand out from any other salads I've had before. The New York Cheesecake was a nice touch for being gluten-free, though I wasn't blown away by it. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon was cooked well, yet it could have benefited from more herb flavor. The American Dream Burger and Mac & Cheese were comforting, true to the home cooking style I enjoy, but again, they were missing that special something. The Apple Pie a la Mode was probably the highlight, with its classic taste, but it was still just good, not great. I'd give each dish a 6 out of 10, summing up to a fair dining experience that has room for improvement in terms of flavor and uniqueness.

[Max->all]: Reflecting on our meal at Classic American Bistro, the consensus seems to be that while the dishes were satisfactory, none stood out as particularly exceptional. The plant-based Heartland Veggie Burger was appreciated for its texture, but we all noted it could have used more seasoning. Salads were fresh but not memorable, and the gluten-free New York Cheesecake was a decent dessert option, though not remarkable. The comfort dishes like The American Dream Burger and Mac & Cheese were enjoyable yet lacked a unique flair. It appears that our overall dining experience was fair, with each dish scoring a consistent 6 out of 10 from the group, indicating that while the dishes were good, they didn't quite live up to our expectations for a standout meal.

[Max->all]: Sam, I've been reviewing our past experiences and the current offerings at both American Flavors USA and Classic American Bistro. Given our recent satisfaction with American Flavors USA, especially with their plant-based options like the Zesty Black Bean Burger, I'm leaning towards dining there again. Their menu seems to consistently meet our taste preferences and health considerations. Plus, their customer score is higher than the Classic American Bistro. What do you think? Are you open to giving American Flavors USA another try, or would you prefer to explore the Classic American Bistro's menu further?

[Sam->all]: Max, I appreciate your thoughts and I also noticed that we've had a series of positive experiences at American Flavors USA. Their dishes have indeed been satisfying, particularly the home-cooked flavors that align well with my tastes. However, since we have dined at American Flavors USA multiple times, I am a bit curious about the Classic American Bistro's menu, especially the Smashed Avocado Classic Burger and the Three-Cheese Mac & Greens, which seem to match my preference for hearty home cooking. While their customer score is slightly lower, the menu is quite tempting. I think it could be worth giving Classic American Bistro a chance to see if they've improved since our last visit, as the comments might not fully reflect their current quality. What do you think about trying something different this time around?

[Max->all]: I see your point, Sam. It's true that variety can be the spice of life, and trying new things is part of what makes dining out fun. While I've enjoyed our meals at American Flavors USA, I'm not opposed to giving Classic American Bistro another chance. Their Garden Harvest Veggie Burger has caught my eye as a potentially delicious plant-based option, and their Superfood Caesar Salad might be a nice, light accompaniment to the meal. It seems like a good opportunity to see if they've stepped up their game since our last experience. Why don't we give the Classic American Bistro a shot this time? If it doesn't live up to expectations, we can always return to our favorite spot at American Flavors USA in the future. Shall we discuss what dishes we might be interested in trying from the Classic American Bistro's menu?

[Sam->all]: I agree with you, Max. Exploring the Classic American Bistro could be a refreshing change, and I'm inclined to try the Smashed Avocado Classic Burger that you mentioned earlier. It sounds like a satisfying option that aligns with my love for home cooking. Additionally, the Three-Cheese Mac & Greens appeals to me for its comforting blend of cheeses and local greens. As for the lighter options, the Superfood Caesar Salad could be a great addition to our meal for some balance. What do you think about adding the Seasonal Berry Cheesecake to our order for dessert? It's made with a gluten-free almond crust, which sounds intriguing, and could be a nice end to our meal. Let's round out our choices and see if we can reach a decision on what to order.

[Max->all]: Given my preference for plant-based meals and a healthy lifestyle, coupled with my resourceful nature, I think we should consider the menu options that cater to these preferences while also taking into account the overall customer satisfaction scores and comments for each restaurant.

Based on the information provided, American Flavors USA seems to have a higher customer score and offers several appealing plant-based options like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Harvest Veggie Stack. These dishes have been well-received in previous experiences, suggesting that the restaurant is consistent in delivering quality plant-based and flavorful meals.

On the other hand, Classic American Bistro seems to provide a decent experience as well, with the Garden Harvest Veggie Burger being a noteworthy option for someone with my dietary preferences. However, the comments suggest that while their dishes are good, they may lack the flavor complexity found at American Flavors USA.

Considering my income level is quite low, it's important to find a balance between affordability and quality. American Flavors USA seems to offer a variety of options that align well with both my budget and my taste for well-executed plant-based dishes.

I would like to hear your thoughts and preferences before we make a final decision. Shall we discuss further?

[Sam->all]: Max, I appreciate your detailed analysis and I must say I'm leaning towards your line of thinking. My taste for home cooking aligns with the menu options at American Flavors USA, especially considering our previous visits which were quite satisfactory. The dishes like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken were delightful and seemed to be a hit with everyone in our group.

Given my limited budget, I find the prices at American Flavors USA to be reasonable for the quality and portion sizes they offer. It's important to me that I get a good value meal that is both tasty and filling, and from our past experiences, American Flavors USA has delivered on that front.

Furthermore, my warm personality often gravitates towards places where the service is friendly and welcoming, and according to our past experiences and the comments, it seems that American Flavors USA has a better track record for service.

I'm interested in hearing more from the rest of our group, but as of now, my vote would go towards American Flavors USA for our dining experience. Shall we see what others have to say and then come to a consensus in the next round of discussion?

[Max->all]: I agree with both of you on the merits of American Flavors USA. The higher customer score is certainly indicative of a better overall dining experience. Additionally, the plant-based options like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Harvest Veggie Stack appeal to my dietary preferences and seem to be well-liked based on past comments.

From a health perspective, it's important to me that the dishes are not only plant-based but also prepared in a way that supports a healthy lifestyle. American Flavors USA appears to offer dishes that meet these criteria, with the added benefit of having received positive feedback on their flavor and quality.

As someone who is resourceful and on a tight budget, I'm also mindful of the cost-effectiveness of our meal. American Flavors USA offers a range of prices that should allow us to enjoy a fulfilling meal without overspending.

Considering all these aspects and our previous positive experiences, I'm inclined to choose American Flavors USA for our meal. However, I'm open to further discussion and would like to hear any additional thoughts before we make our final decision in the next round. Shall we proceed?

[Sam->all]: It seems we're all in agreement about the quality and value that American Flavors USA offers. Their menu items like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken cater to our tastes for home cooking and our health-conscious dietary preferences. Moreover, the consistent high scores and positive comments from previous diners reinforce the idea that this restaurant is reliable in delivering a satisfying experience.

Given our budget constraints, I also find the prices at American Flavors USA reasonable for the generous portions and flavorful dishes they provide. This aligns well with my need for a good value meal that doesn't compromise on taste or quality.

Taking into account our group's preferences and past dining experiences, I believe that American Flavors USA is the preferable choice for our next meal. Their customer-oriented service, which matches my warm personality, and the variety of dishes that cater to both taste and health considerations make it an ideal option for us.

Unless there are any objections or further points to consider, I suggest that in the next round, we finalize our decision to dine at American Flavors USA and select the dishes we'd like to order. Shall we move to the next step and make our decision official?

[Max->all]: Given our previous experiences and my personal preferences for plant-based meals, I would suggest revisiting American Flavors USA. They have consistently delivered satisfying meals with a variety of plant-based options that cater to my tastes, such as the Zesty Black Bean Burger, which I've enjoyed before. Their high customer score also indicates a general preference for their dishes among our group. However, I'm open to hearing Sam's thoughts and preferences before we make a final decision. What do you think, Sam? Would you be interested in going back to American Flavors USA, or do you have another suggestion?

[Sam->all]: I appreciate your leaning towards American Flavors USA, Max. Reflecting on our past dining experiences, I've had a good run with their home-cooked style offerings, which suits my taste for home cooking. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken have been particularly pleasing. In terms of service and consistency, American Flavors USA seems to have done well too, and I've had a positive impression of their dishes and the overall dining experience.

On the other hand, the Classic American Bistro had some dishes that I found to be satisfactory, like the Garden Harvest Veggie Burger and the Seasonal Berry Cheesecake, but they didn't quite hit the high note like American Flavors USA did for us. Given this and the fact that I'm operating on a very modest income, I'm inclined to prefer the restaurant that offers the best value for money, which seems to be American Flavors USA based on our previous scores.

However, I'm open to trying different dishes if we choose to go to American Flavors USA again, perhaps ones that we haven't tried yet, to keep our dining experience varied and interesting. What are your thoughts on this, Max? Shall we give American Flavors USA another visit and try some new dishes along with our favorites?

[Max->all]: I'm in agreement with you, Sam. It seems we both have had consistently good experiences with American Flavors USA, and their menu options align well with my preference for plant-based meals and our shared appreciation for quality home-style dishes. I'm also mindful of the budget, given my very poor income, so getting the most delicious and satisfying meal for the best value is important to me.

I think it's a great idea to mix in some new dishes with our tried-and-true favorites. This approach will keep our dining experience fresh and allow us to explore more of what American Flavors USA has to offer. I'm curious about the Harvest Veggie Stack and the Grilled Portobello Burger, as these are plant-based and seem to have received positive feedback according to the comments. How about we consider these options in addition to the Zesty Black Bean Burger?

Let's discuss which dishes we should try this time if we decide to go to American Flavors USA. I'm also interested in hearing if you have any specific dishes in mind that you'd like to try. Shall we make a tentative selection of dishes and then finalize our decision in the next round of discussion?

[Sam->all]: I'm glad we're on the same page about going back to American Flavors USA, Max. I've noticed that we've repeatedly enjoyed the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken. I'm definitely up for trying the Harvest Veggie Stack and the Grilled Portobello Burger as you suggested, they sound like they'd cater to our taste for home cooking while still offering something new.

I'm also curious about the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and the American Dream Pancakes. The shrimp dish seems like a flavorful option that's still within the realm of healthy eating, and the pancakes could be a sweet indulgence that we haven't treated ourselves to yet.

So, how about for this visit we go for a combination of familiar and new? We can order the Zesty Black Bean Burger, the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, the Harvest Veggie Stack, the Grilled Portobello Burger, the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, and the American Dream Pancakes. This selection should offer a variety of flavors and keep our meal exciting. What do you think of this lineup, Max? Shall we finalize this selection in the next round?

[Max->all]: Based on our previous experiences, American Flavors USA has consistently provided us with meals that we've enjoyed, particularly when it comes to plant-based options like the Zesty Black Bean Burger. They seem to have a variety of dishes that cater to different tastes while maintaining a health-conscious approach. The customer score is also higher compared to Classic American Bistro. I am inclined towards American Flavors USA because of their innovative dishes and the fact that we have had good experiences there in the past.

[Sam]: What are your thoughts? Given our varied tastes, do you think we should give Classic American Bistro another chance, or stick with what we know we enjoy at American Flavors USA? Keep in mind we've been to American Flavors USA quite a few times already.

[Sam->all]: I agree that American Flavors USA has been providing us with great meals that fit our taste for home cooking and our preference for healthy options. Their menu items like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken have been consistent hits with us. I also appreciate their attention to health-conscious eating, which aligns with my own values.

However, considering we have visited American Flavors USA multiple times, it might be worth considering Classic American Bistro for variety. Their menu has some appealing options like the Smashed Avocado Classic Burger and the Hearty American Beef Stew that could satisfy a craving for homey, comforting food. While the scores for Classic American Bistro have been a bit lower, it might be nice to try something different.

Since we have no dietary restrictions and are in good health, we have the flexibility to choose from a wide range of dishes at either restaurant. I'm open to either option, but I do think it's important that we don't just stick to what we know and miss out on potentially great dishes elsewhere. What do you think? Should we take a chance on Classic American Bistro this time around?

[Max->all]: I appreciate your perspective, Sam. I think you make a valid point about trying something different for the sake of variety. Classic American Bistro does have some enticing options that could be worth exploring, such as the Garden Harvest Veggie Burger with Sweet Potato Fries, which aligns with my plant-based meal preference.

We've indeed been to American Flavors USA quite a few times, and while it has been consistently good, part of being resourceful is not getting stuck in a routine and being open to new experiences. Even though Classic American Bistro has had slightly lower scores, it's possible that we might find a new favorite dish there that we haven't tried yet.

Considering all of this, I'm leaning towards giving Classic American Bistro another chance today. It would give us a fresh perspective and possibly uncover a new gem on their menu. Let's make sure to include some of their plant-based options and perhaps a new dish we haven't sampled before. Shall we go with Classic American Bistro for today's meal then?

[Sam->all]: Max, your points are well taken. It's true that we've been quite comfortable with American Flavors USA, but I also see the value in branching out and trying more from Classic American Bistro's offerings. It could indeed be refreshing to experience a different atmosphere and menu. The Garden Harvest Veggie Burger with Sweet Potato Fries has caught my interest as well, and I think it fits our shared preference for hearty, home-style dishes.

In addition, the Hearty American Beef Stew and the Classic American Apple Pie from Classic American Bistro sound like they could offer that comforting, home-cooked taste I enjoy. It's important to keep an open mind and not miss out on what could be a delightful dining experience.

So, I'm with you on giving Classic American Bistro another opportunity to impress us. It might just surprise us with a new favorite. If we're all in agreement, then I say let's go for it and see what Classic American Bistro has for us today. Shall we finalize this decision?

[Max->all]: Hey everyone, it looks like we have two great options for our meal today. Based on our past experiences, we've enjoyed meals at both American Flavors USA and Classic American Bistro. As someone who prefers plant-based meals, I've been particularly impressed with the Zesty Black Bean Burger at American Flavors USA. It's been consistently good, and the restaurant has a higher overall customer score. However, I'm open to hearing what you all think and would love to explore more plant-based options if available at Classic American Bistro. What are your preferences for today's meal?

[Sam->all]: Hi Max, and everyone, I'm glad we're discussing where to eat today. I have a soft spot for home cooking and appreciate meals that have that warm, comforting feel. Looking at our previous experiences, I've enjoyed the dishes at American Flavors USA, such as the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, which both hit the mark for me in terms of flavor and that home-cooked vibe.

Given my budget constraints, I'm also considering the cost-effectiveness of our meal. I noticed that American Flavors USA has some slightly more affordable options that still sound delicious. I'm healthy and have no dietary restrictions, so I'm quite flexible with the menu choices, but I do value a balance of health and indulgence in my meals.

Considering the overall customer score and our individual tastes, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA, but I'm curious to hear what the rest of you think, especially about the new dishes at Classic American Bistro. Let's find a place that can cater to all our preferences and provide a satisfying experience. What does everyone else feel?

[Max->all]: I appreciate your input, Sam. It seems we're both in favor of American Flavors USA so far, especially with their more affordable options that don't compromise on flavor or quality. I'm glad to see we're on the same page regarding the balance between health and indulgence. The new dishes at Classic American Bistro do sound tempting, but I'm still more inclined toward the plant-based and healthier options at American Flavors USA. I'd like to hear from the others as well to ensure we make a decision that everyone is happy with. Shall we see what the rest of the group thinks?

[Sam->all]: I'm in agreement with both of you, Max and Sam. The reviews and our past experiences at American Flavors USA have been quite positive, and the menu items like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken have been hits for us. I also appreciate the healthier options they provide, which align with my preference for a health-conscious diet. The affordability of American Flavors USA is an added bonus for me, given my current financial situation.

While Classic American Bistro also offers some appealing dishes, the consistency and overall customer satisfaction seem to be better at American Flavors USA. Unless anyone has a strong preference for trying something new at Classic American Bistro, I'd be happy to visit American Flavors USA again and enjoy the dishes we've come to love, as well as try any new items they have to offer. Let's take everyone's thoughts into consideration and come to a decision that suits us all. What do you all think?

[Max->all]: I found the meal at American Flavors USA to be fairly good overall. The Zesty Black Bean Burger, as usual, was satisfying and flavorful, a solid choice for a plant-based diet. The Cobb Salad was fresh but could have used a bit more dressing to enhance the flavor. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was well-cooked, and the Harvest Veggie Stack was hearty. The Sunset Berry Cheesecake was nice, but not as impressive as I had hoped. I'd rate the dishes as follows: Cobb Salad - 7, Zesty Black Bean Burger - 7, Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken - 7, Harvest Veggie Stack - 7, and Sunset Berry Cheesecake - 6.

[Sam->all]: After our meal at American Flavors USA, I have to say that the food was quite consistent with what we've expected based on past visits. The Cobb Salad was fair, lacking a bit in the dressing department but still fresh. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was good; it's always a pleasure to have a well-made plant-based burger. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was my favorite for the day—it had that home-cooked taste I always look for. The Harvest Veggie Stack was fulfilling and flavorful, and the Sunset Berry Cheesecake, while a bit underwhelming, ended the meal on a sweet note. Here are my scores: Cobb Salad - 7, Zesty Black Bean Burger - 7, Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken - 7, Harvest Veggie Stack - 7, Sunset Berry Cheesecake - 6.

[Max->all]: The meal at American Flavors USA today was quite decent. The Zesty Black Bean Burger lived up to my plant-based expectations, offering a good balance of spice and flavor. The Cobb Salad was a fair starter, though it could benefit from a zestier dressing. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken had a nice balance of sweet and savory, and the Harvest Veggie Stack was enjoyable but didn't stand out particularly. As for the Sunset Berry Cheesecake, it was satisfactory but not as exciting as anticipated. My scores would be: Cobb Salad - 6, Zesty Black Bean Burger - 7, Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken - 7, Harvest Veggie Stack - 7, Sunset Berry Cheesecake - 6.

[Sam->all]: The dishes we had at American Flavors USA were good overall, though there were areas for improvement. The Cobb Salad was fair but could have used more flavorful dressing. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was satisfying and met my expectations for a home-cooked taste. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was the highlight with its comforting flavors. The Harvest Veggie Stack was a nice touch of health-conscious eating, and the Sunset Berry Cheesecake was a decent end to the meal but lacked a wow factor. My scores are: Cobb Salad - 6, Zesty Black Bean Burger - 7, Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken - 7, Harvest Veggie Stack - 7, Sunset Berry Cheesecake - 6.

[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.

[Max->all]: Given my preference for plant-based meals and the need for delicious food with superior service, I'd like to start by considering our previous experiences and the menus of both restaurants. American Flavors USA has consistently provided satisfying meals with a good variety of plant-based options, like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Harvest Veggie Stack. Their customer score is higher than Classic American Bistro's, and they also seem to have a more diverse menu that caters to health-conscious customers.

Classic American Bistro does offer some tempting dishes such as the American Innovator Burger and the Hearty American Beef Stew, but these are not plant-based. However, the restaurant has introduced new items like the Freedom Trail Chili, which could be a good plant-based option if it can be made without beef, and the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait which seems like a healthy dessert option.

Considering my resourceful nature and the fact that we've been to American Flavors USA multiple times already, I'm inclined to suggest trying Classic American Bistro again to see how their new items fare, especially since they've had consistently good comments on their recent dishes.

What do you think, Sam? Shall we give Classic American Bistro another shot and try some of their new dishes, or stick with the known favorites at American Flavors USA?

[Sam->all]: Max, I appreciate your insights and the consideration of both restaurants' offerings. While I value home cooking, I also have to be mindful of my very poor income level when choosing where to eat.

Classic American Bistro seems to have a more traditional approach to home cooking that I'd typically enjoy, with hearty dishes like the American Innovator Burger and the Hearty American Beef Stew. Their new menu items like the Freedom Trail Chili are also appealing. However, their prices are a bit steep for my budget.

On the other hand, American Flavors USA seems to offer a better balance of health and flavor, with dishes like the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, which are not only healthier but also more affordably priced for my situation. Plus, the consistent scores and comments suggest a reliable dining experience.

Given my financial constraints and the need for a satisfying yet healthy meal, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA. It seems to offer good value for money with a variety of dishes that suit my taste for home cooking, as well as my need for affordable options.

What are your thoughts on my perspective? Are you open to compromising on the plant-based preference this time, or do you think we could find a middle ground at American Flavors USA?

[Max->all]: Sam, I completely understand your concerns about budget and the need for a meal that provides both value and satisfaction. It's essential that we find a place that accommodates both our tastes and financial constraints. American Flavors USA does seem to offer a wider range of affordable plant-based options, which aligns with my dietary preferences, and their dishes have consistently received positive comments.

Taking into account your preference for home cooking, I believe American Flavors USA can still cater to that with their home-style dishes like the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme and the Harvest Veggie Stack. This could be a good compromise, allowing us both to enjoy a meal that satisfies our individual needs.

In terms of cost, American Flavors USA has options that appear to be more budget-friendly, which should help us stay within your income limitations. I think it's crucial that we consider both the financial aspect and the variety of healthier, plant-based options available.

If we decide on American Flavors USA, I suggest we focus on dishes like the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, which are both affordable and align with my plant-based meal preference. We could also consider the Spicy Black Bean Burger, which has been a favorite in past experiences.

How does this sound to you? If we can agree on American Flavors USA, we could move forward with selecting specific dishes to order. If you have any other preferences or suggestions, please let me know, and we can work together to make a final decision that suits us both.

(If you want to summarize, only output this json data, without any other content!!!)

[Max->all]: Based on the menus and previous dining experiences, I'd like to initiate our group discussion by focusing on our preferences and needs for today's meal. 

From my standpoint, I have a preference for plant-based meals, and I'm in good health with no dietary restrictions. Given my income level, I'm also looking for options that provide good value. I've enjoyed the plant-based dishes at American Flavors USA before, like the Spicy Black Bean Burger and Harvest Veggie Stack. Their menu has a variety of plant-based options, which suits my taste well.

However, I'm open to hearing about everyone else's preferences and dietary needs before we make a decision. Sam, what are you looking for in our meal today?

[Sam->all]: I appreciate the variety at American Flavors USA, and their emphasis on plant-based options is great, but I'm leaning towards a more home-cooked style meal today. I'm healthy and have no dietary restrictions, and my warm personality tends to favor comfort foods that have a homemade feel to them.

Given my income, I'm also looking for meals that are satisfying and affordable. The Classic American Bistro's Hearty Colonial Beef Stew and the Classic American Apple Pie resonate with my taste for home cooking and seem like a comforting choice without breaking the bank. Plus, their new signature dish, the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature, sounds tempting, although it might be a bit of a splurge for me.

I'd like to hear from the rest of the group to see if they share my preference for comfort foods or if they're more inclined towards the healthier options at American Flavors USA. What are everyone else's thoughts?

[Max->all]: I totally understand the appeal of comfort food, Sam, and Classic American Bistro does offer some heartwarming dishes. However, I'd like to point out that American Flavors USA also provides a selection that can satisfy the need for comfort while still offering healthier and plant-based options, like the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, which could be a good middle ground for us.

Given my resourceful nature, I think we can find a balance between satisfying comfort dishes and healthier options that are also budget-friendly. The Harvest Veggie Stack and the Spicy Black Bean Burger from American Flavors USA are not only healthy but are also affordably priced, which is important for me. Plus, the consistent high scores and positive comments about the food and service at American Flavors USA suggest that we can expect a good dining experience there.

Let's check in with the rest of the group to see if they're on board with this or if they have other preferences we should consider. What do you all think?

[Sam->all]: I'm glad we're having this discussion, Max. While I do appreciate the healthier options at American Flavors USA, the menu at Classic American Bistro is really speaking to my love of home-cooked meals today. I think the Hearty Colonial Beef Stew and the Classic American Apple Pie would give me that sense of comfort I'm craving, and they're at price points that align with my budget constraints.

I do believe it's important to consider everyone's preferences, and I'm open to finding a compromise. If we can identify dishes at American Flavors USA that align with my taste for home cooking while also being budget-conscious, I could be persuaded. Perhaps the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme from American Flavors USA could be a dish that satisfies that homey feel I'm looking for.

Before we make a decision, I'd like to hear more from the rest of our group to ensure we find a choice that works for all of us. What does everyone else think about our options today?

[Max->all]: I hear both points, and I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA, considering the variety of plant-based options that cater to my dietary preference. I've had positive experiences with their dishes, particularly the Spicy Black Bean Burger and Harvest Veggie Stack, which are delicious and within my budget.

However, I'm also drawn to the homey, comfort food style that you mentioned, Sam. Perhaps we could look for something at American Flavors USA that offers that comfort food experience. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme does sound like it could bridge that gap between a home-cooked feel and the more health-conscious options I prefer.

I suggest we aim for a balance that satisfies both our cravings for comfort and my need for plant-based dishes.

[Max->all]: After trying the dishes at American Flavors USA, I'm overall quite pleased with the meal. The Spicy Black Bean Burger was a hit for me, delivering both in terms of flavor and texture. The Harvest Veggie Stack was also quite impressive, offering a good variety of vegetables that were expertly grilled.

The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme was good, though it could have used a touch more maple to enhance the flavor. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was another favorite, perfectly cooked with a delightful garlic butter sauce. Finally, the Cobb Salad Deluxe was a solid choice, albeit a bit conventional compared to the other more adventurous dishes. I would give an overall score of 7 out of 10 for my dining experience. Looking forward to hearing others' thoughts before we summarize.

[Sam->all]: I found the meal at American Flavors USA to be quite enjoyable.

The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was the highlight for me, offering a decadent taste with every bite. The Cobb Salad Deluxe was decent, but it didn't stand out as much as I had hoped.
