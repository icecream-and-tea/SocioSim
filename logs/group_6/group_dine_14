[Dexter->all]: Considering my personal preferences and the information provided, I lean towards Classic American Bistro for our dining experience. Their Smokey BBQ Ribs seem very appealing considering my taste for barbecue, and it appears that their offerings are slightly more upscale, with dishes like Grilled Salmon and Pulled Pork Sandwich that sound delicious. The price point is a bit higher, but given my income, it's not a concern, and I value quality and good service. The fact that they highlight their use of fresh, high-quality ingredients is also a plus for me. What are your thoughts on this? Shall we give it a try or would you prefer checking out American Flavors USA?

[Ulysses->all]: Dexter, I appreciate your inclination towards Classic American Bistro. It does indeed have an enticing menu, especially with their emphasis on the quality of ingredients and variety of dishes. Given my adventurous personality, I'm always eager to explore diverse flavors, and their menu has a nice mix of classic American comfort food and other options like the Grilled Salmon, which could offer a more international flair. Although American Flavors USA also provides a good selection of American cuisine, the menu at Classic American Bistro seems a little more refined, which aligns well with my tastes and the fact that we both aren't restricted by any dietary limitations. I'm in favor of your suggestion, and I'm curious to taste their Smokey BBQ Ribs and New York Cheesecake. Let's wait and see what the others have to say before we make a final decision. Shall we?

[Dexter->all]: Ulysses, I'm glad to hear that you're also interested in the Classic American Bistro. Their Smokey BBQ Ribs and New York Cheesecake do seem like they would satisfy our cravings for American cuisine with a touch of refinement. Since we are both on the same page regarding this choice, it would be great to hear from the others. If everyone agrees, I think we could have a fantastic dining experience at Classic American Bistro, enjoying both the familiar comfort food and some of their more unique offerings. Let's see if the rest of the group is on board with this idea or if they have a different preference.

Dexter was particularly interested in the Smokey BBQ Ribs, while I found the Grilled Salmon and New York Cheesecake appealing due to my adventurous taste. The higher price point of Classic American Bistro was not a deterrent, considering our income levels, and we both value quality and good service.

[Dexter->all]: Well, I must say, the Smokey BBQ Ribs were not quite as I had anticipated. They were good but just shy of being impressive, I'd give them a fair score. The Classic Cheeseburger and Fried Pickles were decent, but nothing to write home about. The New York Cheesecake and Apple Pie a la Mode were satisfying enough, but again, not outstanding. Overall, I'd rate our meal at Classic American Bistro as fairly average, with a bit of room for improvement. I'm thinking a score of 6 out of 10 seems right for my overall experience. What's your take on the meal, Ulysses?

[Ulysses->all]: The dishes at Classic American Bistro provided a comfortable yet somewhat unremarkable dining experience. The Smokey BBQ Ribs had potential but fell slightly short of expectations. The Grilled Salmon was cooked well, yet it didn't excite my palate as I had hoped. As for the New York Cheesecake and Apple Pie a la Mode, they were pleasant but not extraordinary. The overall meal was consistent in quality, albeit lacking a true wow factor. For an adventurer like myself, it was a solid but safe culinary journey. I would give the meal a score of 6 out of 10. Let's collect everyone's scores and comments before we finalize our group review.

[Dexter->all]: Reflecting on the meal at Classic American Bistro, I found the dishes to be satisfactory, but they didn't quite meet my expectations for a truly memorable barbecue experience. The Smokey BBQ Ribs had a decent flavor but didn't offer the smoky punch I was looking for. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was tasty, though not exceptional. The Caesar Salad was fresh, but it was what you would expect from any standard salad. The desserts, particularly the New York Cheesecake, were the highlights for me, providing a sweet end to the meal. I would rate the overall experience as a 6 out of 10, taking into account the high expectations I had going in. How did the rest of you feel about the meal?

[Ulysses->all]: Reflecting on our meal at Classic American Bistro, I found the offerings to be fairly average, which was somewhat disappointing given the anticipation built by the menu descriptions and our discussion prior to dining. The Smokey BBQ Ribs had nice flavor but lacked a truly smokey depth that I had hoped for. The Grilled Salmon was satisfactory, though it didn't stand out in terms of flavor or presentation. On the dessert front, the New York Cheesecake and Apple Pie a la Mode were enjoyable, but they didn't distinguish themselves from versions I've had elsewhere. The meal as a whole was consistent in quality, but it didn't offer the culinary excitement I was looking for as an adventurous eater. I expected a bit more from a restaurant with such an enticing menu. I agree with the others and would also rate the meal at a 6 out of 10. Shall we proceed to summarize our final review?

[Dexter->all]: Considering the overall experience and the consensus among us, it seems appropriate to give a summarized score that reflects the fair but not exceptional quality of the meal we had. The dishes were decent, and while there were no major flaws, the meal didn't reach the level of excellence we were hoping for. Given this, I will compile our final review.

}

[Ulysses->all]: Reflecting on our meal at Classic American Bistro, the dishes were generally fair, but none managed to truly captivate my taste buds. The Smokey BBQ Ribs, which I had been looking forward to, did not deliver the rich, smoky flavor I had anticipated. The Grilled Salmon was competently prepared, yet it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi that would elevate it beyond the average. The New York Cheesecake was probably the best part of the meal, but even that was not exceptional enough to leave a lasting impression. As someone who enjoys exploring international cuisines and unique flavors, I found the meal to be somewhat underwhelming. I was hoping for a culinary adventure, but what I got was a safe and predictable dining experience. I must agree with the others and give the meal a score of 6 out of 10. Shall we finalize our review with this score?

[Dexter->all]: Reflecting on the dining experience at Classic American Bistro, it's clear that the dishes were competent but didn't quite live up to the high expectations we set based on the menu and the restaurant's presentation. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were good, but I missed the strong smoky flavor that I love in barbecue. The Caesar Salad and Fried Pickles were standard fare, and while the desserts, especially the New York Cheesecake, were enjoyable, they weren't particularly memorable. It seems that our meal was consistent in its quality, but it lacked that special something that would make it stand out. I'd have to agree with Ulysses and give the overall meal a score of 6 out of 10. Shall we move forward with this as our final group review?

[Ulysses->all]: Reflecting on our visit to Classic American Bistro, I found the experience to be comfortably familiar but not particularly adventurous or exciting. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were tender, yet they didn't quite hit the smoky notes I was looking for. The Grilled Salmon was good, a decent attempt at a classic dish, but it didn't leave a lasting impression. The New York Cheesecake and the Apple Pie a la Mode were probably the most enjoyable parts of the meal, but even so, they were not out of the ordinary. As an explorer of international cuisines, I was hoping for a bit more excitement on the plate. The dishes were uniformly fair, but none stood out as exceptional. I'm in agreement with the group and would rate the meal as a 6 out of 10. Shall we finalize our group review with this score?

[Dexter->all]: Reflecting on the collective feedback about our meal at Classic American Bistro, it seems that although the dishes were prepared to a fair standard, they didn't quite meet the expectations that we had. The Smokey BBQ Ribs, while decent, didn't deliver the impactful smoky flavor that I was particularly looking forward to. The Classic Cheeseburger and Fried Pickles were average, and the Caesar Salad was a commonplace offering. The desserts, such as the New York Cheesecake and Apple Pie a la Mode, while satisfying, didn't stand out as exceptional. Overall, my impression aligns with the group's consensus that the meal was solid but lacked the excitement and distinctive flavors we anticipated from the menu's promise. I agree with the score of 6 out of 10 for our dining experience at Classic American Bistro. Shall we conclude with this assessment?

[Ulysses->all]: Reflecting on our meal at Classic American Bistro, I found that while the food was satisfactory, it did not quite live up to the exciting culinary adventure I was anticipating. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were tender but could have used a more pronounced smoky flavor. The Grilled Salmon was well-prepared yet lacked the unique flair I seek in international cuisine. The desserts, including the New York Cheesecake and Apple Pie a la Mode, were comforting but not particularly standout. Overall, the quality of the dishes was consistent, but the experience did not meet the adventurous standard I typically enjoy. I concur with the group's sentiment and also rate our meal a 6 out of 10. Shall we finalize our group review with this score?

[Dexter->all]: Reflecting on our dining experience at Classic American Bistro, it seems that the general consensus among us is that the food was satisfactorily prepared but didn't quite reach the heights of culinary excellence we were hoping for. The Smokey BBQ Ribs, which I had a particular craving for, were enjoyable but lacked that intense smokiness that characterizes great barbecue. The rest of the dishes, like the Classic Cheeseburger and the Fried Pickles, were decent but not particularly noteworthy. The desserts, including the New York Cheesecake and the Apple Pie a la Mode, were probably the highlight of the meal, yet they didn't distinguish themselves enough to elevate the overall dining experience. Taking all this into account, I agree with the group's score of 6 out of 10 for our meal at Classic American Bistro. Shall we settle on this as our final review?

[Dexter->all]: Hey Dexter, looking at both options, I think we should consider the flavors and service based on the comments. Classic American Bistro seems to have a higher score, but not by much. What do you think?

[Dexter]: I agree, Ulysses. The scores are close, but the Classic American Bistro has the edge. Given my preference for barbecue, their Smokey BBQ Ribs and Signature Smokey Ribs really catch my eye. Plus, the customer comments suggest their desserts are a highlight, so the New York Cheesecake or Apple Pie a la Mode could be a sweet end to the meal. How do you feel about those options?

[Ulysses]: I'm leaning towards the same, Dexter. The ribs do sound appetizing and a good dessert is always a plus. As long as the service is good, which the comments seem to suggest, I'm happy to go with Classic American Bistro. Shall we discuss which dishes to order?

[Dexter]: Sure, let's pick out some dishes. I'm definitely in for the Signature Smokey Ribs. Maybe we should consider a variety to cover different tastes. How about adding the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon and a Pulled Pork Sandwich? And for dessert, one New York Cheesecake and one Apple Pie a la Mode. What do you think?

[Ulysses]: Sounds like a solid selection, Dexter. The variety should keep everyone pleased. I'm good with the choices you've proposed. If we're ready to finalize, I can put together our order for the next round of discussion.

[Dexter->all]: Well, the Signature Smokey Ribs had a good smoky flavor, but I expected a bit more tenderness. I'd rate them as fair, so a 7 out of 10 from me. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon was decently cooked, though it lacked a bit in flavor, so it's a 6. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was enjoyable, another 6 for that. The New York Cheesecake and Apple Pie a la Mode were both alright, nothing spectacular, so they each get a 6. What do you think, Ulysses?

[Ulysses->all]: I'd agree with your assessment, Dexter. The Signature Smokey Ribs had a robust smoky flavor, but I was expecting them to fall off the bone a bit more, so that's a 6.5 from me, which I'll round to a 7 for simplicity. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon was nicely cooked but could use more seasoning, so a 6 there. The Pulled Pork Sandwich had the right balance of flavors but nothing out of the ordinary, another 6. The desserts were pleasant, but I was hoping for a wow factor — both the New York Cheesecake and Apple Pie a la Mode get a 6 from me. Shall we summarize our experience and rate the restaurant?

[Ulysses->all]: Reflecting on our culinary adventure at American Flavors USA, I am left with a sense of satisfaction and delight. The BBQ Ribs, while not the most tender I've encountered, still had a robust smoky flavor that I enjoyed. The Smokin' Hot Brisket was a delightful combination of smoke and spice, and it did not disappoint. The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were a standout, with a perfect balance of heat and flavor that truly tantalized my taste buds. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was a sweet and savory wonder, beautifully cooked to enhance its flavors. The Grilled Portobello Burger was a revelation, proving that a vegetarian dish can be as hearty and flavorful as any meat-based option. Lastly, the New York Cheesecake was a creamy, rich, and not overly sweet conclusion to our meal. I am in complete agreement with the others and would rate our dining experience at an 8 out of 10. The quality and execution of each dish were commendable, creating an overall delightful dining experience.

[Dexter->all]: Hey Dexter, given our past experiences, it seems like we've consistently enjoyed our meals at American Flavors USA. Their barbecue dishes, like the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and the Smokin' Hot Brisket, really stood out. Considering your preference for barbecue, I think we should consider going back there. What are your thoughts?

[Ulysses->all]: Hey Dexter, I'm inclined to agree. American Flavors USA has consistently delivered in terms of both flavor and service. As an explorer of cuisines, I'm eager to try some new items on their menu as well as revisit the ones we've loved in the past. Perhaps we could consider the Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak or the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken this time around, along with our favorites. What do you think?

[Dexter->all]: Ulysses, I'm on board with heading back to American Flavors USA. The barbecue options have indeed been excellent, and I'm particularly fond of the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp. Since we're both open to trying new dishes, the Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken sound like great additions. I'm also curious about the American Dream Pancakes for a little sweet indulgence. Let's make sure we get a good mix of our past favorites and some new flavors to keep our dining experience exciting. Shall we finalize our choices in the next round?

[Ulysses->all]: Dexter, I think we're on the same page about returning to American Flavors USA. The Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken would be great new dishes to try.

[Dexter->all]: The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were a standout as usual, definitely maintaining their 'Good' status. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was also delicious, with that garlic butter really shining through. The Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak had a nice balance of flavors, though not as remarkable as our favorites, still 'Good'. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken had a lovely sweet and savory glaze, but it didn't wow me. As for the American Dream Pancakes, they were a pleasant end to the meal, but not as impressive as I had hoped. Here are my individual scores: Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers - 9, Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp - 9, Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak - 8, Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken - 8, American Dream Pancakes - 8.

[Ulysses->all]: The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers lived up to my expectations once again; they were truly delectable. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp didn't disappoint either, offering a robust flavor that I thoroughly enjoyed. The Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak was a satisfying new venture; it had great texture and taste. I found the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken to be good, with a nice glaze, although it wasn't the highlight of the meal. The American Dream Pancakes were a good finish, sweet and comforting, yet not extraordinary. My individual scores are as follows: Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers - 9, Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp - 9, Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak - 8, Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken - 8, American Dream Pancakes - 8.

[Dexter->all]: The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers definitely hit the spot with their robust flavors and perfect level of spiciness. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was also a hit with its flavorful, buttery sauce. The Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak was a great choice, hearty and satisfying. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was good, but it didn't stand out as much as the other dishes. The American Dream Pancakes were a nice sweet treat to end the meal, though not particularly exceptional. My scores are: Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers - 9, Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp - 9, Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak - 8, Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken - 8, American Dream Pancakes - 8.

[Ulysses->all]: The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were definitely a hit, as they always are, with just the right amount of kick. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was a close second, rich and flavorsome with the garlic butter. The Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak was quite enjoyable, though it didn't quite reach the heights of the other two dishes. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was tasty, with a good balance of sweetness from the maple, but it wasn't a standout. Lastly, the American Dream Pancakes were a nice finish to the meal, offering a classic comfort but nothing too exciting. Here are my scores: Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers - 9, Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp - 8, Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak - 8, Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken - 8, American Dream Pancakes - 7.

[Dexter->all]: The meal at American Flavors USA was quite enjoyable overall. The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were exceptional, and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was cooked to perfection. The Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak, while good, didn't quite leave a lasting impression compared to the skewers and shrimp. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was well-executed, though it didn't particularly stand out. The American Dream Pancakes were a sweet ending to our dining experience, but they didn't dazzle us as much as we had hoped. Here's how I would score them: Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers - 9, Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp - 9, Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak - 8, Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken - 8, American Dream Pancakes - 7.

[Dexter->all]: Hey Dexter, given our previous experiences, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA for our meal today. The service has been consistently good, and the dishes have really impressed us, especially the barbecue options which I know you love. What do you think?

[Ulysses->all]: I agree, Dexter. American Flavors USA seems to be a better fit for my taste for international cuisine, as their menu items like the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp highlight diverse flavors that I'm eager to explore further. Plus, their commitment to health-conscious dining aligns with my healthy lifestyle. Shall we consider trying some new dishes from their menu as well?

[Dexter->all]: Absolutely, I'm all in for heading back to American Flavors USA. The barbecue options have been consistently satisfying, and I'm always up for a good brisket or those Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers. Their menu also offers a variety of dishes that cater to both our health-conscious choices and my love for sociable dining with hearty flavors. I think we should definitely try some of their new offerings, maybe the Zesty Black Bean Burger or the Harvest Veggie Stack, to mix things up a bit.

[Ulysses->all]: I'm excited about visiting American Flavors USA again, Dexter. Their menu has been consistently appealing, and it aligns well with my adventurous palate. I'm particularly interested in the Zesty Black Bean Burger, which sounds like a flavorful vegetarian option that's both healthy and satisfying. Additionally, the Harvest Veggie Stack and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken could be interesting new dishes to try, offering a range of tastes and textures. Since we've had positive experiences with the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp before, it might be a good idea to include them as well, ensuring we have a balance of familiar and new flavors. Shall we finalize our choices in the next round of discussion?

[Dexter->all]: I'm on board with that plan, Ulysses. It's settled then, we'll go for American Flavors USA once again. I'd like to suggest we order the following dishes to satisfy both our familiar favorites and the urge to try something new: the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, which we know we love, and we'll add the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Harvest Veggie Stack to our order for a taste of their new offerings. We should also get the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, as it sounds like a delicious balance of sweet and savory. If everyone is in agreement, we can finalize this as our selection in the next round.

[Dexter->all]: Hey Dexter, considering our previous experiences and your love for barbecue, I think we should stick with American Flavors USA today. Their Smokin' Hot Brisket has been consistently on point, and it aligns perfectly with your taste for barbecue. Plus, we've been scoring them pretty high, and I'm definitely in the mood for their Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp again. What do you think?

[Ulysses->all]: Dexter, I agree that American Flavors USA has been a solid choice for us, and their consistency is certainly appealing. However, as someone who enjoys exploring new flavors, I'm tempted by the Classic American Bistro's menu. The Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken and the Autumn Chicken & Pomegranate Salad caught my eye as dishes that offer a different taste profile from what we've had lately. We're healthy, have no dietary restrictions, and can afford to try something new. How about we give the Classic American Bistro a chance tonight? It might be refreshing to switch things up a bit. What are your thoughts on trying something different for our meal today?

[Dexter->all]: Ulysses, I see your point about trying something new, and I'm all for variety. Classic American Bistro does have some tempting options like the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich and Patriot's Prime Ribeye Steak, which could satisfy my barbecue cravings. Since we have no dietary restrictions and we're both sociable, it could be fun to experience a different atmosphere and meet new people. Plus, it's healthy to mix up our routine a bit. I'm leaning towards giving Classic American Bistro a shot. Let's discuss it further and see if we can agree on this or if American Flavors USA's tried and true dishes are the way to go tonight. What do you think?

[Ulysses->all]: Dexter, I appreciate your openness to trying Classic American Bistro. While I enjoy the familiar flavors at American Flavors USA, the spirit of exploration is calling. Classic American Bistro's menu, particularly the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Steak and the Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken, seems like it could offer a new culinary adventure for us. Considering our healthy lifestyle and absence of dietary restrictions, it's a great opportunity to experience a different side of American cuisine. I'm also curious about their dessert options, like the Classic American Apple Pie. Shall we go for Classic American Bistro tonight, then decide on the dishes that would give us a broad taste of their offerings? What do you say we finalize this and look forward to a new dining experience?

I've been looking at Classic American Bistro's menu, and it seems like they've got some interesting dishes like the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection and The American Innovator Burger that could be a nice change. Given our taste for international cuisine and your explorer personality, it might be fun to try something different. How do you feel about giving Classic American Bistro a shot?

[Dexter->all]: Hey, I'm open to mixing things up a bit. While I've thoroughly enjoyed our meals at American Flavors USA, especially the barbecue dishes which are right up my alley, it might be nice to explore Classic American Bistro's menu.

Both chicken dishes, the Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken and the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl, were flavorful and provided a lighter contrast to the meal. Overall, I'd give each dish a solid 8 out of 10.

[Ulysses->all]: I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Classic American Bistro. The American Innovator Burger was a standout with its rich bourbon BBQ sauce, and the truffle fries were a decadent touch. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe was another highlight, with the spicy honey-BBQ sauce adding a delightful zing. The Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection was succulent and well-seasoned, and it paired beautifully with the balsamic-glazed brussels sprouts. The Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken offered a lovely citrusy note that was refreshing, while the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl had a great smoky flavor that was perfectly balanced. Each dish, for me, deserves an 8 out of 10.

[Dexter->all]: The visit to Classic American Bistro was quite a treat. The American Innovator Burger was juicy and flavorful with that bourbon BBQ sauce adding a unique touch. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe had just the right amount of spice, and the coleslaw gave it a nice crunch. The Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection was a meat lover's dream, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The lighter dishes, the Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken, and the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl, were both delicious and balanced the meal well. I'd rate each dish an 8 as well. The quality of the food and the overall experience was consistent with what we had expected based on the menu and previous reviews. It's a solid 8 out of 10 from me.

[Ulysses->all]: The dining experience at Classic American Bistro was a resounding success. The American Innovator Burger was beautifully composed with a savory bourbon BBQ sauce that elevated the dish, and the accompanying truffle fries were a luxurious treat. The Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe impressed with its harmonious blend of spicy and sweet, and the tender pork was a delight. The Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection was truly a prime choice, with its succulent, well-seasoned meat that was a testament to the chef's skill. The Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken was refreshingly zesty, providing a lighter yet equally satisfying option, while the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl was a well-executed dish with a satisfyingly smoky depth. I'm pleased to rate each dish with an 8 out of 10 for their execution and the pleasure they brought to the palate.

[Dexter->all]: Hey everyone, based on our barbecue preference and our past experiences, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA again. Their Smokin' Hot Brisket has been consistently good, and I think we've all enjoyed the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp in the past. Plus, they seem to have new items like the Bold-Spiced Sweet Potato Wedges that could be a nice addition to our meal. What does everyone else think?

[Ulysses->all]: I definitely understand the draw to American Flavors USA, given our positive history with them. However, I'm feeling a bit adventurous today and I'm intrigued by Classic American Bistro's Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature. It's been advertised as a new signature dish crafted by Chef Ramsey, and it seems like it could be a delightful new experience. Plus, their overall customer score is quite close to that of American Flavors USA, so it might be worth exploring the menu there. How about giving Classic American Bistro a chance tonight? What are your thoughts on trying something different this time?

[Dexter->all]: Ulysses, I see your point about trying something new, and the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature does sound tempting. Given that we've been frequenting American Flavors USA quite a bit, a change could be refreshing. Let's also consider the overall experience and service, not just the food. Both places have provided us with good service, but it might be nice to switch up the atmosphere. If Classic American Bistro can offer a comparable barbecue experience with some innovation, I'm open to giving it a shot. I'd love to hear what others in the group think before we make a final decision.

[Ulysses->all]: I appreciate the points both of you have made. Dexter, the consistency at American Flavors USA is certainly appealing, and their dishes like the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp have indeed been a hit with us. On the other hand, Ulysses, your suggestion to venture into something novel at Classic American Bistro resonates with my explorer personality. The Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature crafted by Chef Ramsey promises a unique culinary experience, and I'm inclined to agree that trying out a new place would align with my adventurous spirit. Plus, their menu has several other enticing options that could satisfy our barbecue tastes and interest in diverse flavors. I think it could be refreshing to step out of our comfort zone and give Classic American Bistro a try tonight. Shall we see if the rest of the group is up for a change of scenery and flavors?

[Dexter->all]: I've been thinking about our options, and I'm inclined to agree with the idea of visiting Classic American Bistro tonight for a change. The Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature has caught my attention as well, and it seems like a dish that aligns with my taste for barbecue. Moreover, it would be nice to experience Chef Ramsey's culinary skills first-hand. Although the customer score is slightly lower than American Flavors USA, it's not a significant difference, and the recent comments about Classic American Bistro are quite positive. I'm also looking at the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe and the Bald Eagle Beef Dip as potential choices—they both sound like they would be right up our alley. Let's see what the rest of the group thinks, but I'm leaning towards Classic American Bistro this evening.
