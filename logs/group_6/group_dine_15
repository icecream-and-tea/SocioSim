[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.
    ],
    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>
}
(If you want to summarize, only output this json data, without any other content!!!)

[Yasmine->all]: Given that I adhere to a vegan diet, I need to ensure that the restaurant we select can accommodate my dietary restrictions with delicious vegan options. From the menus provided, I notice that both restaurants are heavily focused on American cuisine, which typically includes a lot of meat-based dishes. However, I need to look for items that are either already vegan or could be modified to be vegan.

At "Classic American Bistro," the only dish that could potentially be veganized is the Caesar Salad, if it can be made without parmesan and the creamy Caesar dressing, which typically contains anchovies. Unfortunately, none of the other dishes appear to be vegan or easily modifiable to vegan.

On the other hand, "American Flavors USA" doesn't explicitly list any vegan options either, but the Cobb Salad might be adaptable if the chicken, bacon, eggs, and blue cheese are removed, leaving just the mixed greens and avocado. The Apple Pie a la Mode could be a dessert option if the pie is made without butter and is served without ice cream.

Neither option is ideal for a vegan, but it appears that "American Flavors USA" might be slightly more accommodating with the possibility of modifying the Cobb Salad. Before making a final decision, I would like to hear what the other members of the group have to say and whether they have any dietary needs that need to be considered as well. If anyone has had previous experiences with these restaurants offering off-menu vegan dishes, that information would also be valuable for this decision.

[Eve->all]: Given my budget and my preference for simple dishes, both restaurants seem to offer options that would satisfy my taste. However, I'm inclined towards items that are more affordable, as my income is quite limited. Looking at the menus, "American Flavors USA" offers lower prices on similar items, such as the Classic American Burger and BBQ Ribs, compared to "Classic American Bistro."

"American Flavors USA" also has a Cobb Salad that can be simplified to fit Yasmine's vegan needs, whereas at "Classic American Bistro," the Caesar Salad would require modifications which may not be possible. Additionally, the Classic American Burger can be a straightforward and satisfying choice for me, being both within my budget and aligning with my simple taste preference.

Furthermore, as someone who is shy, I would prefer a place that might not be too crowded or loud. Since there are no customer scores or comments available to assess the atmosphere of either restaurant, I would lean towards the one that seems less upscale based on the menu prices, as it might offer a more casual and comfortable environment.

Before making a final decision, I would like to hear more opinions from the group, especially regarding service quality, as that is also important to me. If others have had positive experiences with the service at either restaurant, that could influence my decision as well.

[Yasmine->all]: Given the preferences and needs that both Yasmine and Eve have outlined, it seems that making a choice that satisfies everyone's requirements might be a bit challenging. Yasmine requires a vegan option, and while neither restaurant has a clearly labeled vegan dish, "American Flavors USA" seems to have a salad that could be more easily modified to meet vegan standards. As for Eve, the lower prices at "American Flavors USA" are more appealing due to budget constraints, and the simpler dishes align with her taste preferences.

I'm also considering the service quality, as Eve mentioned. Since we don't have customer scores or comments to refer to, we might have to base our expectations on the attentiveness of the staff to special dietary needs and their willingness to modify dishes. With this in mind, "American Flavors USA" might be our best bet, as they would need to accommodate Yasmine's vegan diet by altering the Cobb Salad.

Before we settle on a final decision, we should consider whether anyone else in the group has specific preferences or restrictions that need to be addressed. It would also be helpful to know if there are any other factors that might influence our choice, such as the ambiance of the restaurant or prior experiences that any of us might have had with either establishment. If no further concerns are raised, we may proceed to the next round of discussion to move towards a final decision.

[Eve->all]: I appreciate the points raised by Yasmine and the other member's consideration of my preferences and needs. Since we are looking to accommodate a vegan diet and also adhere to a budget, "American Flavors USA" does seem like the more suitable choice. The potential to modify the Cobb Salad to be vegan-friendly addresses Yasmine's dietary restrictions, and the lower prices are better for my financial situation.

Additionally, I agree that the service quality is an important factor. Although we do not have concrete reviews to refer to, it would be reasonable to expect that a restaurant offering dishes at a lower price might be more casual and possibly more accommodating to special requests, which would be beneficial for both Yasmine and me.

As we have not heard any other preferences or restrictions from the group, and considering the factors discussed, I propose that we choose "American Flavors USA" for our meal. The availability of simpler, more affordable dishes and the potential for accommodating a vegan diet seem to align with our group's needs. If everyone agrees, we can consider this in the next round as our final decision.

Before we move to the final round, I invite any further input or concerns from the group members to ensure that we are making an inclusive choice for all.

[Yasmine->all]: {

    "summary": "After discussing our individual preferences and requirements, we have decided that 'American Flavors USA' is the most suitable restaurant for our group. Yasmine, who follows a vegan diet, identified that the Cobb Salad could be modified to fit her dietary needs. Eve expressed a preference for more affordable and simpler dishes, which 'American Flavors USA' offers. Since there were no other specific preferences or restrictions mentioned by the group, and taking into consideration the need for a potentially more accommodating service for Yasmine's vegan requirements, 'American Flavors USA' was chosen. The decision was also influenced by the lack of customer scores or comments, leading us to infer that a less expensive restaurant might provide a more casual and comfortable atmosphere for Eve's shyness and budget considerations."

[Yasmine->all]: The modified Cobb Salad was a decent attempt to accommodate a vegan diet, but the lack of protein and creative vegan substitutes left it feeling a bit uninspired and lacking. I'd rate it a 5 out of 10 as the freshness of the greens and avocado was there, but it didn't quite make for a satisfying meal. The Classic American Burger, based on what I could observe, seemed to be average in taste according to Eve. Considering that the burger scored a 0.56, I would equate that to a score of about 5.6 out of 10. There's definitely room for improvement in terms of flavor and perhaps even presentation. Overall, my experience was fair, but I've had better vegan meals elsewhere.

[Eve->all]: The Classic American Burger was quite basic. It wasn't the best I've had, but it wasn't terrible either. The patty was a bit dry and the special sauce wasn't as flavorful as I expected. It filled me up, but it didn't leave a lasting impression. I would rate the burger a 6 out of 10 because while it was affordable and aligned with my simple tastes, the overall experience could have been better with a juicier patty and more flavorful sauce. I believe there's potential for this dish to be improved with some minor adjustments. I look forward to hearing the others' opinions on their meals.

[Yasmine->all]: Reflecting on our meal at "American Flavors USA," I found the modified Cobb Salad to be quite plain. While I appreciate the effort to cater to my vegan diet, the dish was missing something to make it more satisfying, perhaps a variety of vegetables or a protein substitute. My score for the salad would be a 5 out of 10, as it was fresh but not fulfilling. Eve's burger seemed to be average, and based on her comments and the given score, I would agree with a score of 6 out of 10. It seems there's room for improvement in both dishes to enhance the overall dining experience.

[Eve->all]: The Classic American Burger was a fair attempt at a simple and affordable dish. It wasn't exceptional, but it did meet the criteria of being budget-friendly and straightforward in flavor. However, the dryness of the patty and the lack of a standout taste in the sauce were disappointing. I'd give the burger a 6 out of 10, considering it was edible and somewhat met my expectations for simplicity and price, but it didn't delight my taste buds. It was an average experience that could be improved with a little attention to the juiciness of the meat and the tanginess of the sauce. I'm curious to see the overall group consensus and the final review score for "American Flavors USA."

[Yasmine->all]: Reflecting on our dining experience at "American Flavors USA," I believe that the consensus is that both the modified Cobb Salad and the Classic American Burger were fair but left room for improvement. Yasmine found the salad to be fresh yet unsatisfactory as a main course, lacking in substance and creativity that is often found in vegan cuisine. Eve found the burger to be average, with specific aspects like the dryness of the patty detracting from the overall enjoyment. Despite these critiques, the effort to accommodate dietary needs and budget constraints was appreciated. I would rate the overall experience as average, with a score that reflects the need for more attentiveness to the quality and taste of the food. 

Given the individual scores of 5 from Yasmine for the salad and 6 from Eve for the burger, I propose an average score of 5.5 out of 10 for our meal at "American Flavors USA."

}

[Eve->all]: The Classic American Burger was satisfactory in terms of its simplicity and affordability, in line with my taste and budget. However, the dryness of the patty was a letdown. My personal score for the burger would be a 6 out of 10, which aligns with the given score of 0.56 (on a scale of 1), translating to a fair but unremarkable experience. I also noticed that Yasmine's modified Cobb Salad was fresh but lacked the heartiness and inventiveness that could have been achieved with some vegan protein options or a wider variety of vegetables. I'm interested to hear what the overall group consensus is and look forward to summarizing our thoughts in the next round.

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and my focus on health and compassionate choices, I would like to suggest that we consider the vegan options available at both restaurants. From the menus provided, "American Flavors USA" offers a Zesty Black Bean Burger, which is a vegan-friendly option. On the other hand, "Classic American Bistro" does not appear to have a clearly marked vegan option on the menu. Based on this, I'm leaning towards "American Flavors USA" for their vegan offering. However, I am open to hearing what others think and whether "Classic American Bistro" can accommodate a vegan diet upon request. What do you all think?

[Eve->all]: [Yasmine], I appreciate your consideration for vegan options, and I agree that it's important for a restaurant to cater to various dietary needs. Since my own preference is for simple dishes and I'm on a tight budget, American Flavors USA seems to be a suitable choice for me as well. Their menu includes straightforward, affordable options like the Classic American Burger and the Mac & Cheese, which I find appealing for my simple taste. Additionally, their customer score is slightly lower than Classic American Bistro, which suggests that there might be room for improvement, but the difference is not significant. I'm in good health and have no dietary restrictions, so I am flexible with the choice of restaurant. I am also a bit shy, so a place with a comfortable and accommodating service would be ideal for me. Let's hear what the others have to say before we make a final decision.

[Yasmine->all]: As I've previously mentioned, my dietary needs as a vegan are quite specific, and I must ensure that whatever I eat aligns with my values and health requirements. American Flavors USA offers a vegan option with their Zesty Black Bean Burger, and this is a strong point in their favor for me. Since Eve also seems to be in favor of American Flavors USA due to the affordability and simplicity of the dishes, I think it's a good option for both of us. We should still consider the opinions of others in our group, taking into account their tastes, budgets, health considerations, and any dietary restrictions they might have. Let's keep the conversation open and ensure that everyone's needs and preferences are heard before we come to a decision.

[Eve->all]: I've heard [Yasmine]'s preference for American Flavors USA based on the vegan options available, and I also find their menu suitable for my taste for simple dishes and my budget constraints. If the others also agree, I think American Flavors USA would be a good choice for us. However, I'd like to hear more opinions before we come to a final decision to make sure that the restaurant we choose accommodates everyone's needs and preferences. Shall we continue the discussion or are we ready to consider a proposal?

[Eve->all]: I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dishes at American Flavors USA. The Classic American Burger was delicious, with a well-cooked patty and fresh toppings. The Mac & Cheese was also quite satisfying, creamy and comforting just as I like it. Both dishes were simple yet tasty, aligning perfectly with my preferences. I would also rate each dish an 8 out of 10. The overall experience was good, considering my budget and taste for simple dishes. The service was accommodating, which is great for someone shy like me. What are the thoughts of others?

[Yasmine->all]: I'm in agreement with Yasmine and Eve regarding the quality of the food at American Flavors USA. Both the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Classic American Burger were good.

Given the overall quality and taste of the vegan and non-vegan options, and considering the service, I would rate each dish an 8 out of 10. It seems like American Flavors USA has improved since our last visit, and it's nice to see they are consistent in their offerings and service. Shall we move on to summarizing our experience in the final review?

[Eve->all]: I must say, I'm quite satisfied with our meal at American Flavors USA. The Classic American Burger was exactly to my liking – simple, yet delicious with a good balance of flavors.

I would happily give an 8 out of 10 for both dishes. It seems we've all enjoyed our choices, and the restaurant has done a great job meeting our diverse needs. I believe we're ready to provide our collective feedback now.

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and my preference for healthy options, I believe American Flavors USA would be a better choice for us. They offer a Zesty Black Bean Burger which aligns with my vegan diet, and the comments from previous visitors suggest that the restaurant has flavorful and health-conscious options. Additionally, my past experiences at American Flavors USA have been positive, with an improvement noted on my second visit. Shall we consider going there again and maybe try the Zesty Black Bean Burger among other dishes that suit our group's varied preferences?

[Eve->all]: Absolutely, Yasmine. I also think American Flavors USA would be a good fit for us. Given my simple tastes, I'm inclined towards classic comfort food, and the Classic American Burger seems like a straightforward choice that I would enjoy. Also, considering we have a healthy approach to eating, the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Cobb Salad seem like great options to maintain that balance. Plus, the service seems to have been consistently commended, which is great for someone like me who's a bit shy. Let's hear what the others think, but American Flavors USA is looking good to me so far! What does everyone else think?

[Yasmine->all]: I agree with Yasmine and Eve's suggestion to go to American Flavors USA. The Zesty Black Bean Burger would be a perfect fit for Yasmine's vegan diet, and it's a healthy choice as well.

The positive comments about their service and the quality of their dishes make it even more appealing. Let's see if the rest of the group agrees, but I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA too. How about we also consider some of their other dishes that might satisfy different tastes in our group?

[Eve->all]: I'm in agreement with the choice of American Flavors USA. The restaurant's offerings seem to cater well to our collective needs, and the positive feedback on both the service and flavor is encouraging. As someone with a preference for simple dishes, I'm personally drawn to the Classic American Burger. I believe it would suit my taste perfectly without being too complex. Given the healthy aspect we're considering, the Cobb Salad seems like an excellent choice to balance out the meal, and it would pair nicely with the burger. I'm curious about the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken as well; it sounds like a dish with a simple yet delicious twist. With Yasmine's vegan preferences and my own inclinations, it seems like American Flavors USA can accommodate us well. Shall we finalize our decision and select dishes that reflect our group's diverse tastes?

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and my preference for healthy options, I find that the Zesty Black Bean Burger at American Flavors USA aligns perfectly with my needs. Additionally, previous experiences at American Flavors USA have been quite positive with scores of 8, indicating that the food and service have been consistently good. The comments from other diners also suggest a satisfying experience with a variety of flavorful dishes, which is important to me as someone who enjoys a culinary adventure while adhering to my vegan lifestyle.

Classic American Bistro, on the other hand, seems to have a more limited selection of dishes that would suit my vegan diet, and the customer scores and comments point to a less exciting dining experience. While they do offer healthier options like the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon and a variety of salads, their focus on traditional American fare with heavy emphasis on meat and dairy doesn't cater well to my vegan needs.

Based on the information provided, I lean towards choosing American Flavors USA for our next meal. However, I am open to hearing what the rest of the group thinks and am willing to discuss further before we make a final decision. What are everyone's thoughts?

[Eve->all]: I appreciate your perspective, Yasmine. Considering my own preferences for simple dishes and my limited income, I'm inclined to agree with you about choosing American Flavors USA. The menu items like the Classic American Burger and the Pulled Pork Sandwich appeal to my taste for straightforward, uncomplicated fare. Moreover, the price points at American Flavors USA seem to be more within my budget, and the positive comments about the food and service make me feel confident that it's a good value for the money.

Additionally, as someone who is healthy and without dietary restrictions, the variety of options at American Flavors USA allows me to choose from both indulgent and healthier dishes, giving me the flexibility to decide based on my mood at the time of dining.

While the Classic American Bistro does offer some appealing dishes like the Mac & Cheese and the Apple Pie a la Mode, the overall customer score and comments suggest that the dining experience might not be as satisfying as what American Flavors USA has been providing consistently.

My shyness might also be better accommodated at American Flavors USA, as the positive feedback about the service indicates a potentially more comfortable environment for someone with my personality. Let's continue our discussion and see if we can reach a consensus in the group.

[Yasmine->all]: I'm glad to hear that you, Eve, are also leaning towards American Flavors USA. It seems like our preferences are aligning quite well. For me, the variety of vegan options and the emphasis on flavor and quality at American Flavors USA are very convincing.

I also notice that the prices are quite reasonable, and it's great that you find dishes within your budget, Eve. Since we both have found appealing options at American Flavors USA that cater to our different tastes and economic considerations, it seems like a suitable choice for us.

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and preference for healthy options, along with my modest income and compassionate nature, it seems reasonable to lean towards a restaurant that offers a good range of vegan options and is known for delicious food and service.

From my past experiences at American Flavors USA, I've been quite satisfied with their vegan offerings, especially the Zesty Black Bean Burger, which has been a highlight. The overall scores and comments for American Flavors USA have been consistently positive. Moreover, they seem to be attentive to dietary needs, which is crucial for me.

Looking at Classic American Bistro's menu, the Garden Harvest Veggie Burger could be a vegan option if the lemon-tahini sauce is dairy-free, and the Superfood Caesar Salad might be suitable if the dressing is vegan. However, the comments suggest that while the food is decent, it lacks the 'wow' factor, and the overall customer score is lower than American Flavors USA.

Therefore, my initial preference would be for American Flavors USA based on my previous positive experiences and the restaurant's ability to cater to my vegan diet with tasty options. I'm open to hearing what the others think and whether they have different needs or preferences that we should consider.

[Eve->all]: I appreciate the healthy and simple dishes that both restaurants provide. My income is quite limited, so affordability is an essential factor for me. From my previous experiences, I've enjoyed the meals at American Flavors USA with a particular fondness for the simplicity and comfort of dishes like the New York Cheesecake and the Zesty Black Bean Burger. The service has been friendly and accommodating, which suits my shy personality well.

Considering the menu options and prices at Classic American Bistro, I see some appealing dishes like the Smashed Avocado Classic Burger and the Superfood Caesar Salad, which are within my taste preferences for simple yet healthy dishes. However, the customer score and comments suggest that the overall experience might not be as impressive as what I've enjoyed at American Flavors USA.

Given this, my initial leaning is toward returning to American Flavors USA, where I know the food and prices align with my preferences and financial situation. I'm interested to hear what the rest of the group thinks and am open to discussion to ensure everyone's needs are met.

[Yasmine->all]: I can see that both Eve and I share similar concerns regarding healthy options and affordability. My experiences at American Flavors USA have been consistently good, not just in terms of the quality and taste of the vegan dishes but also the service. The Zesty Black Bean Burger has been a highlight for me, and it's encouraging to see that Eve also enjoyed the dishes there, particularly the vegan-friendly options.

The customer score and feedback for American Flavors USA are quite positive, and it appears to be a place that can cater to both our dietary preferences without compromising on taste or service. While Classic American Bistro has some interesting items on their menu, the feedback indicates that the flavors may not be as memorable, and their customer score is notably lower than American Flavors USA.

Considering our shared preferences for healthy, vegan-friendly options and the positive past experiences we've both had, I would also suggest we revisit American Flavors USA. However, I'm open to considering any counterpoints or different views from the rest of the group before we make a final decision.

[Eve->all]: My experience at American Flavors USA has been generally positive, and taking into account the limited budget and preference for simple dishes, I find their menu to be a good fit. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and the New York Cheesecake are dishes that I have enjoyed before and are both affordable and simple, aligning with my taste and financial constraints. Given the consistently high scores and positive comments, the food quality and service seem reliable.

While Classic American Bistro's menu has some appealing options, the comments about the lack of standout flavors and the lower customer score make me hesitant to choose it over American Flavors USA. The ambiance at American Flavors USA has been comfortable for me as someone who is shy, and the service has been accommodating.

Therefore, I am leaning towards choosing American Flavors USA for our dining experience. However, I'm open to hearing other opinions and ensuring that the choice reflects the preferences of the entire group. Let's continue our discussion to reach a decision that satisfies everyone's needs.

[Yasmine->all]: As we've discussed our preferences and past experiences, it seems that we are both inclined to choose American Flavors USA for our meal. This choice aligns with our dietary restrictions, taste for healthy and vegan options, and our income considerations. The consistently positive feedback and our own satisfying experiences there make it a compelling choice.

The Zesty Black Bean Burger at American Flavors USA has been a recurring favorite for both of us, and I believe it would be best to include it in our order. Given that we are looking for healthy and vegan-friendly options, as well as considering the affordability, I propose we select dishes that meet all our criteria.

In the next round, we can finalize our order from American Flavors USA, including the Zesty Black Bean Burger and any other dishes that we find appealing and within our budget. Let's aim to make a decision that ensures a delightful dining experience for both of us.

[Eve->all]: I agree with Yasmine that American Flavors USA seems to be the best option for us. The menu offers a variety of dishes that cater to our preferences for simple, healthy food, and the prices are suitable for my budget. The Zesty Black Bean Burger is a dish I've enjoyed in the past, and I'd be happy to have it again.

Considering the positive experiences we've both had at American Flavors USA, and the high customer scores and comments, I'm confident in our choice. It's nice to find a place that provides both a comfortable atmosphere for someone shy like me and delicious, affordable food that aligns with our tastes.

In line with our discussion, I'm ready to move forward with selecting our dishes from American Flavors USA in the next round, ensuring they are both enjoyable and within our financial means. We should finalize our decision on which dishes to order, making sure we have enough for our group and that the choices reflect our shared dietary and taste preferences.

[Eve->all]: I thoroughly enjoyed the Zesty Black Bean Burger; its flavor was robust and it had a pleasing texture, so I'd give it a 7.9 out of 10. The Grilled Portobello Burger was flavorful, with the mushroom cap being a highlight, deserving a 7.7. The New York Cheesecake finished the meal on a high note, creamy and just the right amount of sweetness, earning a 7.4 from me. American Flavors USA has once again provided a satisfying meal that fits within my budget and meets my preference for simple, wholesome dishes.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Yasmine->all]: It seems we've been visiting American Flavors USA quite consistently and have had overall positive experiences, with a particularly good range of vegan options which suits my dietary restrictions. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Grilled Portobello Burger have been highlights for me.

Given the options at Classic American Bistro, the Garden Harvest Veggie Burger with Sweet Potato Fries appears to be a vegan-friendly choice, but based on the customer scores and comments, the dishes might lack the flavor complexity I've enjoyed at American Flavors USA.

Considering all factors, my inclination is towards American Flavors USA once again, as they seem to offer more delicious food and have provided superior service in our past experiences. Plus, they have a variety of dishes that cater to our group's different tastes and dietary needs.

I'd like to hear everyone else's thoughts before we make a final decision. What are your preferences and dietary considerations for today's meal?

[Eve->all]: I appreciate you sharing your perspective, Yasmine. I agree that American Flavors USA has been serving us well, especially with their vegan-friendly options which cater to your dietary restrictions. I've enjoyed the simple yet satisfying dishes like the Classic American Burger and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, which suit my preference for simple dishes.

While the menu at Classic American Bistro sounds tempting, especially with items like the Smashed Avocado Classic Burger, I'm a bit hesitant due to their lower customer score and the comments suggesting that the flavors might not be as impressive or consistent as what we've experienced at American Flavors USA.

Given my limited budget, the affordability of the dishes at American Flavors USA is also a factor worth considering. Their menu has provided good value for money during our previous visits.

I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA for today's meal, considering the satisfaction we've had there before, the variety of dishes that accommodate our tastes, and the consistently good service. However, I'm open to hearing more from the others to ensure we reach a decision that meets everyone's needs.

[Yasmine->all]: I'm glad to hear that we're on the same page regarding American Flavors USA, Eve. The value for money is certainly a consideration for me as well, given my budget constraints. It's also comforting to know that the restaurant has been consistently providing us with delicious meals and accommodating service, which are important factors for an enjoyable dining experience.

I also value compassion and it seems that American Flavors USA has been quite considerate in offering diverse options that are inclusive of different dietary needs, such as vegan options for myself.

Before we decide, let's make sure that everyone in our group has a chance to weigh in with their preferences and any dietary restrictions they might have. Once we've heard from everyone, we can move towards a decision that will hopefully satisfy the entire group. Shall we invite the others to share their thoughts?

[Eve->all]: As someone who prefers simple dishes and has to be mindful of my budget, I've found that American Flavors USA has consistently met my needs. The dishes like the Classic American Burger and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken have been both satisfying and affordable. I don't have any specific dietary restrictions, so I have a bit of flexibility when it comes to the menu.

I'm a bit shy, so the idea of going back to a place where we've already been treated well is appealing to me. I feel more comfortable with the familiar service and setting of American Flavors USA, where we seem to have established a good rapport.

Considering all this, I'm inclined to go with American Flavors USA for our meal today. But of course, I'm open to hearing from the rest of the group and taking into account everyone's preferences and needs before we make our final decision. What does everyone else think?

[Yasmine->all]: I appreciate the input from both of you. It's clear that American Flavors USA has been a reliable choice for our diverse tastes and dietary requirements. As a vegan, I've been particularly satisfied with the options available to me there, such as the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Grilled Portobello Burger, which have been consistently delicious and align with my compassionate lifestyle.

The customer score and positive comments for American Flavors USA also suggest that we have a better chance of enjoying our meal there, given our past experiences. On the other hand, while Classic American Bistro offers a Garden Harvest Veggie Burger that could work for me, the feedback doesn't seem as promising in terms of flavor complexity and overall satisfaction.

Given all these considerations, including the service, taste, health, and budget, I'm also leaning towards choosing American Flavors USA for today's meal. It's important that we all enjoy our dining experience, so I'd like to hear from any other members of our group before we come to a final decision. Any further thoughts?

[Yasmine->all]: Given my income constraints, preference for vegan options, and focus on healthy eating, I would suggest we visit American Flavors USA. They have consistently provided us with delicious vegan options like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Grilled Portobello Burger, which have been highlights of our previous dining experiences. Their service has been commendable, and the dishes seem to be well-aligned with my dietary restrictions and health considerations.

Moreover, my compassionate nature appreciates the atmosphere where all dietary needs are respected and catered to, which seems to be the case at American Flavors USA based on our previous experiences and the restaurant's menu options.

I am open to hearing what the others in the group think and whether they have any other preferences or considerations we should account for before making our final decision.

[Eve->all]: I agree with Yasmine's suggestion to visit American Flavors USA. My income is limited, so I appreciate that the restaurant offers a range of dishes that seem affordable, like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and Harvest Veggie Stack. I also prefer simple dishes and, based on our previous experiences, it seems like American Flavors USA offers a variety of options that cater to this preference without being overly complex or exotic in flavor.

I'm in good health and have no dietary restrictions, so I appreciate the balance between wholesome and indulgent choices at American Flavors USA. The atmosphere of friendly service is also important to me as someone shy; it's comforting to return to a place where we've had positive interactions.

I'm looking forward to hearing what the rest of our group thinks and am ready to discuss further to reach a decision that works for everyone.

[Yasmine->all]: I appreciate both Yasmine's and Eve's points regarding American Flavors USA. It's important that we consider the cost, as well as the variety and quality of food, especially since we have diverse tastes and dietary restrictions within our group. American Flavors USA has a higher customer score and has consistently met our expectations in the past, especially by offering delicious vegan options that cater to Yasmine's dietary restrictions. 

Furthermore, the service has been friendly, which makes the dining experience more enjoyable for everyone, including those of us who are more reserved, like Eve. The positive experiences we've had there previously should not be overlooked, and it seems like a safe choice that aligns with our group's needs.

However, let's keep the discussion open for any additional thoughts or concerns. Maybe we can also consider trying a new dish from their menu this time to add some variety to our experience. What does the rest of the group think?

[Eve->all]: I think sticking with American Flavors USA is a wise choice for us. Given my simple taste in food and the need to stick to a budget due to my limited income, the dishes at American Flavors USA seem to offer a great balance between affordability and flavor. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and Harvest Veggie Stack not only fit my financial constraints but also align with my preference for simple, wholesome meals.

Health-wise, the restaurant's options like the Cobb Salad and Grilled Portobello Burger are appealing because they offer nutritious meals without compromising on taste. As a shy person, returning to a restaurant where we've had friendly service in the past is a comforting thought, and it seems like American Flavors USA has consistently provided that welcoming atmosphere.

I'm curious to try something new, maybe the Harvest Veggie Stack, for a change while still enjoying the dishes that we've liked previously. I'm open to suggestions from the rest of the group as well, especially if there are new dishes we haven't tried yet that could be interesting. What does everyone else think? Shall we finalize our choice or are there other opinions to consider?

It was cooked just right, making it a clear 'Good' on my scale. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was also quite enjoyable; even as someone with simple tastes, I found it flavorful and satisfying. The Harvest Veggie Stack was the perfect choice for a health-conscious eater like myself, fresh and full of natural flavors. And for dessert, the Sunset Berry Cheesecake was a perfect balance of sweet and tart, not too heavy after the main course. For an overall score, considering the taste, health aspects, and my personal enjoyment, I would rate our experience at American Flavors USA an 8 out of 10.

[Yasmine->all]: Given the consistently good scores for all the dishes we tried at American Flavors USA, with each dish receiving positive remarks for flavor, freshness, and healthfulness, I believe we can confidently rate our overall dining experience highly. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and Harvest Veggie Stack were particularly impressive, catering well to vegan dietary needs while also being enjoyed by non-vegans. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken received high praise for its flavor profile, and the Sunset Berry Cheesecake was a hit for dessert. Taking into account the quality, satisfaction, and how well the restaurant met our diverse dietary preferences, I would rate our dining experience an 8 out of 10.

[Yasmine->all]: I've noticed that we've been dining at American Flavors USA for several days now and while the experiences have been consistently good, especially for the vegan options like the Zesty Black Bean Burger, it might be nice to consider trying something different to change up our routine. Classic American Bistro seems like a potential option, as they do offer a vegan dish, the Garden Harvest Veggie Burger, which could be a good alternative for me. However, their overall customer score is lower than that of American Flavors USA. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and preferences before we make a decision. What do you all think?

[Eve->all]: I appreciate your perspective, Yasmine, and I agree that it's nice to switch things up occasionally. The Garden Harvest Veggie Burger at Classic American Bistro does sound appealing for you, and while I'm always up for trying new things, I also have to consider my simple taste preferences. 

Classic American Bistro has some straightforward options like the American Dream Deluxe Burger and the Hearty American Beef Stew that could satisfy my simple tastes. However, I've enjoyed the menu at American Flavors USA, particularly the simple yet satisfying dishes like the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and the Grilled Portobello Burger. 

Given that my income is on the lower end, I also need to consider the cost-effectiveness of our dining experience. American Flavors USA has been consistent with their food quality and service, which makes me feel comfortable with our dining experiences there.

Moreover, as someone who's shy, I find the friendly and familiar service at American Flavors USA to be comforting, which is an important factor for me when dining out.

I'm open to trying Classic American Bistro, but I do have a slight preference for sticking with American Flavors USA due to the positive experiences we've had so far. Let's hear from the others before we decide.

[Yasmine->all]: I understand where both of you are coming from. It's true that American Flavors USA has been a great choice for us, particularly because they offer delicious vegan options like the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Grilled Portobello Burger that align with my dietary restrictions and compassionate values. Their service has been commendable, and it's been a comfortable place for us, especially considering our budget constraints.

On the other hand, I do think it's important to have variety in our dining experiences. Classic American Bistro's Garden Harvest Veggie Burger could be a nice change, and trying a new place might be refreshing. But, the lower customer score does give me pause, and I would not want to compromise on the quality of vegan options and service that we've been enjoying.

Given our different tastes and preferences, it's a tough decision. Maybe we can hear more about Classic American Bistro from others who have tried it, or if there are any particular dishes there that they'd recommend, especially for a vegan diner like myself. Let's keep the discussion open and see if we can find a good balance for our next dining experience.

[Eve->all]: I appreciate the points both of you have made. It's clear that American Flavors USA has consistently met our expectations, and as someone who prefers simple dishes and values friendly service, I've been quite happy with our experiences there. The familiar atmosphere at American Flavors USA has been particularly comforting for me as a shy person, and this familiarity can be quite nice.

On the other hand, I see the appeal in trying Classic American Bistro for some variety. The Hearty American Beef Stew and the American Dream Deluxe Burger seem like they could be to my taste, and they're priced reasonably, considering my income level.

However, given my financial situation, I'd lean towards choosing the option where I'm more certain of the value and quality I'll be getting for my money. With American Flavors USA, we know what to expect in terms of both food and service. Therefore, my preference would still be for American Flavors USA, but I'm open to considering Classic American Bistro if others feel strongly about trying something new and can vouch for its quality and service. Let's continue our discussion and come to a decision that works for everyone.

[Yasmine->all]: Thank you, Eve, for sharing your thoughts. It seems like we both appreciate the consistent quality and service at American Flavors USA, and the dishes there have been a good match for our vegan and simple taste preferences while also fitting our budget. However, I also understand the value of variety and trying new experiences, which Classic American Bistro could offer.

Given our experiences and preferences, I would suggest we stick with American Flavors USA for one more meal. We know they have vegan options that I can enjoy and dishes that cater to your simple tastes, Eve. Plus, we have been enjoying both the food and the service there, which is important to us.

If we feel like we need a change after our next meal, perhaps we can plan to visit Classic American Bistro the following day, giving us a chance to look into more reviews or gather more information about their vegan options and service quality.

Let's keep our options open for the future, but for today, my vote would be for another meal at American Flavors USA. Shall we proceed with this plan?

[Eve->all]: I think Yasmine's proposal makes sense. It's important to have a balance of trying new things and sticking with what we know and enjoy. American Flavors USA has provided us with consistently good meals that cater to our vegan preferences and my simple taste, along with friendly service that suits my personality. 

Given our positive experiences there, and considering my financial constraints, I feel more confident going back to American Flavors USA for another meal. I would be happy to try Classic American Bistro another time when we might have more information about their offerings and service.

Since we're both leaning towards American Flavors USA for today's meal, I agree with Yasmine's suggestion. Let's opt for American Flavors USA for now and consider trying Classic American Bistro in the future. Shall we finalize this decision?

[Yasmine->all]: The Zesty Black Bean Burger was quite good, with a nice balance of flavors and a satisfying texture. I felt it was a good representation of what a vegan burger can be, though I've had slightly more flavorful versions in the past. I'd give it a 7.2 out of 10. The Grilled Portobello Burger was equally enjoyable with a well-cooked mushroom and tasty toppings, so I'll also rate it a 7.2. The Cobb Salad was fresh and the zesty dressing was a nice touch, deserving a 7. The Sunset Berry Cheesecake had a great texture and wasn't too sweet, which I appreciate, but I missed the depth that a richer base might have provided, so it gets a 6.8 from me. Overall, the meal was satisfying and I felt that the vegan options were well-executed.

[Yasmine->all]: The meal at American Flavors USA was quite satisfying on the whole. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was a delightful vegan choice, and I would give it a 7.2 out of 10 for its flavor and texture. The Grilled Portobello Burger also met my vegan needs well and gets the same score of 7.2. The Cobb Salad's fresh ingredients and zesty dressing made it a solid choice, deserving a score of 7. While the Sunset Berry Cheesecake was good, it could have had a bit more flavor intensity, so I'll rate it a 6.8. All in all, the dishes were good, and I appreciated the vegan-friendly options that were available.

[Eve->all]: The Zesty Black Bean Burger was quite good, offering a robust flavor that I enjoyed. It's a strong choice for a vegan burger and it gets a 7.2 out of 10 from me.

The Cobb Salad was a refreshing part of the meal with its crisp greens and flavorful dressing, earning a solid 7. The Sunset Berry Cheesecake was the least impressive for me, but it was still a decent dessert with a balanced sweetness, so I'd give it a 6.8.

[Yasmine->all]: Given my income constraints and personal preference for vegan options, I would lean towards American Flavors USA. The Zesty Black Bean Burger has consistently been a favorite, and it's important for me to have delicious and satisfying vegan choices. The service has been friendly, which is also important to me. What do you all think?

[Eve->all]: I agree with Yasmine, American Flavors USA seems like a great option considering my income and health-conscious approach to eating. I appreciate the simple yet flavorful dishes they offer, such as the Cobb Salad and the Harvest Veggie Stack. The Zesty Black Bean Burger also seems like a delicious, healthful choice. Plus, the friendly service will make me feel more comfortable given my shy nature. What does everyone else think?

[Yasmine->all]: I've had positive experiences with American Flavors USA in the past, particularly enjoying the Zesty Black Bean Burger which aligns with my dietary preferences. The Harvest Veggie Stack also sounds appealing as a health-conscious and vegan-friendly option. Given the consistent quality and accommodating service that American Flavors USA provides, I'm inclined to dine there again. However, I'm open to hearing other opinions before we make a final decision. What are your thoughts on the options presented by both restaurants?

[Eve->all]: I'm with Yasmine on this. The positive experiences we've had at American Flavors USA have shown that they cater well to our dietary preferences and the service is good, which is great for my shyness. I'm also on a tight budget, so their prices are reasonable for me. The Cobb Salad and Harvest Veggie Stack from American Flavors USA seem like good choices that fit my simple tastes and healthy eating habits. Let's see if anyone else has any input before we decide. What are your preferences and thoughts?

[Yasmine->all]: I think American Flavors USA is a fantastic choice as well. The menu offers a variety of dishes that cater to different dietary needs, including vegan options like the Harvest Veggie Stack and the Zesty Black Bean Burger, which are perfect for Yasmine. The Cobb Salad also seems like a versatile dish that can be adapted for a vegan diet by omitting certain ingredients, making it a good choice for Eve's health-conscious eating habits. The consistent high scores and positive comments about the food and service at American Flavors USA suggest that it's a reliable place for a good meal. It's also great to see that they have budget-friendly options, considering the different income levels in our group. Shall we settle on American Flavors USA for our meal, then?

[Yasmine->all]: The Harvest Veggie Stack and Zesty Black Bean Burger were good, aligning with my vegan diet and tasting fresh. However, I was hoping for a bit more flavor complexity. The Cobb Salad had to be modified to fit a vegan diet, which was a bit of a compromise. Overall, my individual scores would be 6.8 for both the Veggie Stack and Black Bean Burger, and 6.6 for the modified Cobb Salad. How did everyone else find their meals?

[Eve->all]: The Cobb Salad was fair, but I expected a bit more vibrancy from the dressing. The Harvest Veggie Stack was quite satisfying in its simplicity and freshness, and the Zesty Black Bean Burger was flavorful, although I would have enjoyed a bit more spice. My scores would be 6.6 for the Cobb Salad and 6.8 for both the Veggie Stack and the Black Bean Burger. What are others' thoughts?

[Yasmine->all]: The meals were generally satisfactory. The Harvest Veggie Stack had a nice array of textures and the vegetables tasted fresh. The Zesty Black Bean Burger had a good balance of flavors, but I would have appreciated a bit more zest. The Cobb Salad was decent, though as a vegan option it wasn't as exciting. My scores are: 6.8 for the Veggie Stack and Black Bean Burger, and 6.6 for the Cobb Salad. Looking forward to hearing others' opinions before we summarize our experience.

[Eve->all]: The dishes we tried at American Flavors USA were quite decent. The Harvest Veggie Stack was fresh and aligned well with my preference for simple dishes, and I appreciated the healthfulness of the meal. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was enjoyable but could use a bit more zest for my taste. The Cobb Salad was fair but not particularly memorable. I'd rate the Harvest Veggie Stack and Zesty Black Bean Burger a 6.8 for their fresh ingredients and the Cobb Salad a 6.6 for its lack of vibrancy. Shall we compile our final review?

[Yasmine->all]: The dishes were generally good and met my vegan dietary needs. The Harvest Veggie Stack had a variety of fresh vegetables, which I appreciated, but I would have liked a bit more seasoning. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was satisfying, though I expected a bit more zest as per its name. The Cobb Salad, once adapted for a vegan diet, was acceptable, but not as enjoyable as it could have been with vegan-friendly dressings or additional toppings. My scores would be 6.8 for the Harvest Veggie Stack, 6.8 for the Zesty Black Bean Burger, and 6.6 for the modified Cobb Salad. What do you all think? Shall we draft our final review now?

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions and preferences, I suggest we consider the vegan options available at both restaurants. American Flavors USA has been a consistent choice for us, and their Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich and Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl seem like they would align with my vegan diet and taste for healthy food. However, I've noticed that the recent scores and comments suggest a slight decline in the quality of the dishes.

Classic American Bistro, on the other hand, does not seem to offer clear vegan options on the provided menu, which is a concern for me. While their customer score is lower, I'm open to giving them a chance if they can cater to my vegan diet with off-menu options or modifications. It's also important to consider that my income level is low, so affordability is a key factor.

I am compassionate and would like to ensure that whatever option we choose is considerate of everyone's dietary needs and preferences. Let's discuss further and see what everyone else thinks.

[Eve->all]: I appreciate the points Yasmine has made, and considering my own preferences and needs, I have to agree that American Flavors USA seems like the more suitable option for us. My income isn't high, so I appreciate the affordability of their dishes, like the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and the Harvest Veggie Stack, which are well within my budget. I also prefer simple dishes, and the straightforward, healthful options like the Cobb Salad Deluxe could be a good fit for my tastes.

While I am shy and not as vocal, it's important for me to feel comfortable in the restaurant we choose. American Flavors USA has provided us with friendly service in the past, which makes it easier for me to enjoy the dining experience. The consistency in their service and the familiarity of the place is something I value.

Given that I don't have any dietary restrictions and I am in good health, I am flexible with the menu choices, but the overall positive experience at American Flavors USA in terms of both food and service, as well as the fact that it caters well to both vegan and non-vegan preferences, makes it my preference. Let's continue the conversation and see if we can come to a consensus.

[Yasmine->all]: I hear both of your perspectives, and I'm inclined to agree that American Flavors USA seems to cater better to our group's needs, particularly with regards to Yasmine's vegan diet and the overall affordability. It's clear that there's a slight dip in their recent scores, but they still seem to maintain a relatively high standard, especially compared to the Classic American Bistro.

I also value the consistent quality and service at American Flavors USA, which is important for a pleasant dining experience. Even though I don't have dietary restrictions, I think it's essential that we choose a place that accommodates everyone's needs, and it seems American Flavors USA has a more varied menu that can cater to all of us.

Let's discuss further and ensure that everyone's needs are being considered before we make a final decision.

[Eve->all]: I'm thankful that Yasmine and I are on the same page regarding American Flavors USA. The menu options there are both affordable and align with my preference for simple, healthy dishes. I also feel more at ease with the service at American Flavors USA, which is something I value as someone who is shy.

Considering Yasmine's vegan diet, American Flavors USA seems to have more to offer, and it's important to me that we choose a restaurant that makes everyone feel included and catered to. I've enjoyed the dishes I've tried there in the past, and while I understand there's been a slight decrease in their recent scores, I believe they still provide a good dining experience that suits our group's needs.

I'm ready to move forward with American Flavors USA unless there are any other considerations or preferences we should discuss from the rest of our group. Let's aim to make a decision that everyone is comfortable with.

[Yasmine->all]: The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was really satisfying, with a robust, smoky flavor that didn't make me miss meat at all. It had a good texture, and the sides complemented it well. I'd give it a 7 out of 10 for being a solid vegan option. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl, while not outstanding, was filling and had a fresh taste, so I think a 7 is fair for this dish too. The Harvest Veggie Stack was perhaps the best of the lot, with perfectly grilled veggies and a delightful balsamic reduction; I'd rate it a 7.2. Lastly, the Cobb Salad Deluxe, while not vegan, seemed to be quite enjoyable and healthy, I would rate it a 6.8 for its fresh ingredients and flavor.

[Eve->all]: I found the Harvest Veggie Stack to be the highlight of the meal for me, with its fresh and flavorful layers of vegetables. I would give it a 7.2 as it was both satisfying and aligned with my preference for simple dishes. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was also quite tasty, offering a good combination of healthiness and flavor, deserving a 7 in my opinion. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich had a nice smoky flavor, although it was not particularly extraordinary, so I'd rate it a 7. The Cobb Salad Deluxe was decent and felt like a wholesome choice, meriting a 6.8 score from me.

[Yasmine->all]: The dishes at American Flavors USA lived up to my expectations, especially considering my vegan dietary restrictions. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was a highlight with its smoky flavor, and I'd rate it a 7 for how well it substituted for a traditional meat option. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was fresh and satisfying, meriting a 7 as it was both healthy and flavorful. The Harvest Veggie Stack, with its well-grilled vegetables and balsamic reduction, stood out with a 7.2 score. Although I didn't try the Cobb Salad Deluxe, it looked appetizing and seemed to offer a good mix of ingredients, so based on appearance and feedback, I'd say it deserves a 6.8.

[Eve->all]: The meal overall was enjoyable with the Harvest Veggie Stack standing out the most for its freshness and flavors, so I'd give it a 7.2. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was good, hearty, and healthy, earning a solid 7. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was quite tasty and a decent vegan option, so it gets a 7 from me.

[Yasmine->all]: I've been frequently dining at American Flavors USA, and while I appreciate their commitment to providing tasty vegan options, I'm intrigued by the new dish advertised by Classic American Bistro, the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature. However, as a vegan, I can't partake in that. I've noticed that Classic American Bistro doesn't seem to have vegan options on their main menu, and my dietary restrictions are a top priority. Based on my previous experiences and dietary needs, I lean towards returning to American Flavors USA, where I know there are satisfying vegan options.

Could you share your thoughts on this? Do you think there might be some off-menu vegan options at Classic American Bistro that we could inquire about? Or would you prefer the reliable vegan choices at American Flavors USA?

[Eve->all]: I appreciate your thoughts, Yasmine. As someone with simple tastes and a modest income, I also prioritize meals that provide both healthful options and good value for money. American Flavors USA has consistently offered dishes that meet these criteria, and I've enjoyed our meals there, especially the healthier options like the Harvest Veggie Stack and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl.

While I am curious about the new offerings at Classic American Bistro, especially the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature, it seems like their menu leans more towards traditional American fare, which may not align with our health-conscious choices. Plus, without clear vegan options, it might not be the best fit for your dietary restrictions.

I would be more inclined to stick with American Flavors USA for the assurance of vegan-friendly dishes and the familiarity with their menu, which seems to also cater well to my preference for simple and healthful meals. What do you think? Should we inquire about possible vegan options at Classic American Bistro or stick to what we know at American Flavors USA?

[Yasmine->all]: I'm glad we are on the same page regarding the importance of having vegan and healthful options, Eve. While the new dish at Classic American Bistro sounds appealing, it doesn't cater to my vegan diet, and there's no clear indication that they offer vegan options that would be satisfying for me. Given our past positive experiences and the variety of vegan dishes that we've enjoyed at American Flavors USA, it makes sense for us to continue dining there.

I think it would be best to stick with American Flavors USA, where we are assured good service and dishes that cater to our dietary preferences. It's also more aligned with our budget, which is an important consideration for both of us. Let's go with the familiar and satisfying options at American Flavors USA. Shall we proceed with this decision in the next round of our discussion?

[Eve->all]: Absolutely, Yasmine. It seems clear that American Flavors USA is the better choice for us, considering the variety of healthful and vegan-friendly options that align with your dietary restrictions and my preference for simple, tasty meals. It also fits within our budget constraints, which is essential for me. Classic American Bistro's menu, although it has some appealing dishes, lacks clear options for your vegan diet, and might not be as health-conscious as we'd like.

I agree that we should opt for American Flavors USA for our meal. We have had good experiences there, and it's reassuring to know that we can have a meal that satisfies both our health considerations and your vegan needs without any uncertainty. Let's confirm this decision in the next round and select our dishes from American Flavors USA. Shall we?

While intrigued by the new offerings at Classic American Bistro, the lack of clear vegan options there could potentially leave me with limited choices, which is a significant concern given my dietary restrictions.

[Yasmine->all]: The dishes we chose from American Flavors USA were overall good. I was particularly impressed with the Harvest Veggie Stack, which had a great combination of flavors and textures; I'd rate it a solid 7.4. The Spicy Black Bean Burger was also quite satisfying, maintaining the same score from me. The Cobb Salad Deluxe was fresh, though I expected a bit more zing from the pickled onions and blue cheese dressing, so I'd give it a 7.3. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was nutritious and flavorful, deserving a 7.2. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was tasty, but I've had better jackfruit preparations, so it gets a 7.2 from me as well. Lastly, the Bold-Spiced Sweet Potato Wedges were a decent side but nothing extraordinary, so a 7.2 score seems fair.

Eve, what are your thoughts on our meal?

[Eve->all]: I found the meal at American Flavors USA to be quite satisfying. The simplicity of the dishes aligns well with my tastes, and the healthful aspect is very much appreciated. The Harvest Veggie Stack was delightful with its fresh vegetables and balsamic reduction, earning a 7.4 from me. The Cobb Salad Deluxe, although a bit underwhelming in zest, was still fresh and gets a score of 7.3. The Spicy Black Bean Burger was flavorful and had a nice kick to it, so I'll also give that a 7.3. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl, while nutritious, lacked a bit in flavor, so it receives a 7.2. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was good, but not as impressive as I had hoped, so it gets a 7.2. Lastly, the Bold-Spiced Sweet Potato Wedges were tasty and well-seasoned, deserving a score of 7.2.

Yasmine, shall we finalize our scores and comments in the next round?

[Yasmine->all]: Certainly, Eve. It seems we both enjoyed the meal with some dishes standing out more than others. The Harvest Veggie Stack was a mutual favorite, and while some dishes like the Cobb Salad Deluxe and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich weren't as impressive as we'd hoped, they were still good. The Spicy Black Bean Burger maintained its flavor profile, and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and Bold-Spiced Sweet Potato Wedges added a nice variety to our meal. I think we're ready to summarize our experience and provide our final review.

I'll go ahead and compile our final scores and comments for our meal at American Flavors USA. Here's our summary:

}

[Eve->all]: The meal we had at American Flavors USA was a pleasant experience overall. The healthful and simple dishes catered nicely to my preferences. I particularly enjoyed the Harvest Veggie Stack for its freshness and the Spicy Black Bean Burger for its flavors. I would rate the Harvest Veggie Stack a 7.4; it was the standout dish for me. The Spicy Black Bean Burger gets a 7.3, as it was a tasty and satisfying option. The Cobb Salad Deluxe, while fresh, was less impressive than I expected, so I will give it a 7.3. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was healthful but could have used a bit more flavor, so it receives a 7.2. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was enjoyable but didn't quite meet my expectations, earning a 7.2. Lastly, the Bold-Spiced Sweet Potato Wedges were a good complement to the meal, deserving a score of 7.2.

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and my preference for healthy options, I would like to advocate for dishes that align with these needs. American Flavors USA has been a consistent choice for us, offering satisfying vegan options like the Harvest Veggie Stack Fire-Roasted Edition and the Zesty Chimichurri Tofu Platter. While the Classic American Bistro has a creative menu, I don't see explicitly vegan dishes, which could be a concern. 

I appreciate the health-conscious approach and the variety of vegan dishes at American Flavors USA. The Zesty Chimichurri Tofu Platter and Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl are particularly appealing to me. 

Can we consider American Flavors USA again for their vegan-friendly options, or does anyone have a different preference or suggestion?

[Eve->all]: I agree with Yasmine that American Flavors USA seems to have a more extensive selection of vegan-friendly and health-conscious options, which suits both of our diets well. I'm also looking for simple dishes, and their menu has items like the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and the Spicy Black Bean Burger that seem to fit that description without being too complex or rich.

Given my shy personality, I appreciate the consistent quality and friendly service that we've experienced at American Flavors USA, as it makes me feel more comfortable. Although Classic American Bistro does offer some healthier options, their menu items appear more complex and might not align as closely with my simple taste preferences.

Therefore, my vote is to return to American Flavors USA, where we know the menu meets our dietary needs and the service is accommodating, making it a good environment for someone with my personality. What do you all think?

[Yasmine->all]: I hear both Yasmine and Eve's points, and it seems like we're leaning towards American Flavors USA for their vegan-friendly and health-conscious choices. Since I also prefer vegan options and appreciate a menu that caters to a healthy lifestyle, I'm inclined to agree with the choice.

The consistent service and the variety in their vegan options give us a chance to enjoy a meal without compromise. The Harvest Veggie Stack Fire-Roasted Edition and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl caught my eye as well, and considering our past experiences, it seems like a good fit for us.

So, shall we decide on American Flavors USA and consider trying some of the dishes mentioned, or does anyone else have any other preferences or dishes in mind from either menu?

[Eve->all]: I'm glad we're all considering American Flavors USA again, as it seems to have options that cater well to Yasmine's vegan diet and my preference for simple, health-conscious meals. I'm also in favor of the restaurant's service, which has been friendly and makes me feel at ease.

I'd be interested in trying the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl for its simplicity and health benefits. The Harvest Veggie Stack Fire-Roasted Edition also sounds like a flavorful yet straightforward dish that aligns with my tastes. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp could be a good option for adding variety to our meal, although it's not vegan, so we should make sure we have enough vegan-friendly dishes for Yasmine.

Since we are all in agreement about the restaurant choice so far, I think we can start considering which dishes to order to ensure we all get something we enjoy. Shall we move on to selecting our dishes?
