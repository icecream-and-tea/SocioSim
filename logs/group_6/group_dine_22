[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.
    ],
    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>
}
(If you want to summarize, only output this json data, without any other content!!!)

[Grace->all]: Considering my income level, I'm looking for a meal that offers value for money. My taste preference leans towards soups and stews, but I'm also diabetic with a dietary restriction that requires low sugar. Given my friendly personality, I appreciate a place that not only serves good food but also has a welcoming atmosphere.

Between Classic American Bistro and American Flavors USA, I notice that both menus have options that could potentially work for me, but I have to be mindful of items that are likely high in sugar and carbohydrates. While the BBQ ribs and cheesecake from Classic American Bistro sound tempting, they are probably not the best choices for my health condition. The grilled salmon from Classic American Bistro, however, could be a suitable option as it is generally a healthier choice with good protein and less sugar.

American Flavors USA has a Cobb Salad that catches my attention, as it includes a mix of protein and vegetables which would be beneficial for my dietary needs. Their menu also seems slightly more affordable, which is a consideration for my middle-class income.

I'm inclined to hear what others have to say, but my initial preference would be for a restaurant with options that cater to my health and dietary requirements while also being budget-friendly. American Flavors USA seems to meet these criteria slightly better with their Cobb Salad and potentially the Pulled Pork Sandwich, which I would inquire about the sugar content in the BBQ sauce. Let's discuss further and come to a decision together.

[Peter->all]: I understand the need to balance taste with health and budget considerations. My income is on the lower side, so I'm also interested in more affordable options. I love baked goods, and I'm in good health with no dietary restrictions, which gives me some flexibility in my choices. My curiosity also drives me to try new things or something that stands out on the menu.

Looking at both menus, the Apple Pie a la Mode from Classic American Bistro and American Flavors USA seems like a delightful treat that aligns with my taste for baked goods. However, Classic American Bistro's version is a bit more expensive. I also notice that Classic American Bistro offers a New York Cheesecake and Mac & Cheese, which could satisfy my love for rich and comfort foods.

On the other hand, American Flavors USA is more budget-friendly, and their menu includes items like the Classic American Burger and the Mac & Cheese at lower prices. Their New York Cheesecake is also cheaper and comes with a strawberry topping, which could be an interesting variation to try.

Considering my curiosity, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA because I feel they might offer a similar experience at a more affordable price, allowing me to try multiple items. Plus, the Pulled Pork Sandwich there is cheaper, which could be a healthy option with less sugar if Grace inquires about the BBQ sauce.

Let's continue the discussion and see what others think before making a final decision together.

[Grace->all]: Thank you for sharing your views, Peter. I appreciate your consideration of budget-friendly options and your adventurous palate. It's great to see that we both have an interest in American Flavors USA due to its affordability and the variety it offers. 

The Apple Pie a la Mode is indeed a classic American dessert, and I'm glad you found an option that caters to your love for baked goods. I agree that the strawberry topping on the New York Cheesecake could be an interesting twist.

Given that you are open to trying new things, I think we can find a good balance between your curiosity and my health and dietary restrictions. I would suggest we look into the sugar content of the desserts and sauces at American Flavors USA to ensure they align with my diabetic needs.

As we proceed with our discussion, I'm curious to hear what other members have to say. Their input will help us make a well-rounded decision that accommodates everyone's needs and preferences. Shall we hear from the others and then reconvene to propose a final solution?

[Peter->all]: It sounds like we're on a similar page, Grace. American Flavors USA does seem to offer a good balance of variety and affordability, which is important for both of us. I'm glad you're considering the sugar content for your health, and I'd be happy to try out their dishes that can meet both our needs.

I'm still drawn to the idea of trying their New York Cheesecake with the strawberry topping, and the Apple Pie a la Mode. I think I'd also go for the Mac & Cheese because it's a personal favorite. As for the main course, the Pulled Pork Sandwich or the Classic American Burger could be a hearty choice, and I'd be keen to inquire about the sugar in the BBQ sauce to make sure it's a fit for you.

We should definitely consider the opinions of other members to ensure that the final decision is inclusive of everyone's tastes and requirements. Once we've gathered more input, we can move towards a final decision that we're all excited about. Looking forward to hearing other perspectives and finding the best option for our group meal!

[Grace->all]: The overall experience at American Flavors USA was decent, but I must admit that the dishes didn't quite meet my expectations for flavor and quality, which is surprising considering the fair scores. The Cobb Salad was fresh, but it lacked a bit of seasoning. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was tender, but the BBQ sauce was a touch too sweet for my preference. The Classic American Burger was satisfactory but not memorable. The Mac & Cheese was comforting, yet it could use more of a cheesy punch. And the New York Cheesecake was good but not outstanding. Given my diabetic diet, I was cautious with the dessert and had just a small taste. I would rate each dish at a 5.6 out of 10, reflecting the fair score provided. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and scores, Peter, before we move on to summarize our overall experience.

[Peter->all]: The meals at American Flavors USA were fair, aligning with the scores given. I found the Apple Pie a la Mode particularly enjoyable, although we didn't order it this time. The Cobb Salad and the Mac & Cheese were adequate but lacked a certain flair that would make them stand out. The Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Classic American Burger were pleasant but not exceptional, with the flavors not being as robust as I had hoped. The New York Cheesecake was enjoyable with the strawberry topping, but it wasn't the best I've had. Overall, I'd give each dish a 5.6 out of 10 as well, which seems to be in line with both the provided scores and Grace's assessment. Let's combine our thoughts to craft our final review.

[Grace->all]: Given my preferences and dietary needs, I would like to start by suggesting that we consider the menu options at Classic American Bistro. They seem to have a dish that could align with my diet and taste preferences, specifically the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon. It appears to be a healthier choice that would likely be low in sugar, which is crucial for my diabetic condition. The Caesar Salad could also be a good starter if we request it without croutons to reduce the sugar intake. I'm open to hearing what the others think and would appreciate their input before we make a decision.

[Peter->all]: I appreciate your perspective, Grace. Looking at both menus, I'm drawn to the baked goods offered by both restaurants, such as the Apple Pie a la Mode and the New York Cheesecake. Since I have a particular liking for baked items, these options are quite appealing to me. Between the two, American Flavors USA has a New York Cheesecake with a rich berry compote that sounds intriguing, and their Apple Pie a la Mode is also priced more affordably. As for the main course, I'm curious to try something new, and the Smokin' Hot Brisket from American Flavors USA catches my eye. It's within my budget, and it seems like a hearty and flavorful dish.

I'm in good health, so I don't have any dietary restrictions to worry about. However, I do have a modest income, so I'm conscious of the price points. American Flavors USA offers more budget-friendly options, which is a consideration for me. I'm also curious about the recent changes they've mentioned in their advertisement, like the upgraded zest in their classic dishes.

I'm looking forward to hearing what others in the group have to say and finding a place that caters to all our preferences. Let's continue our discussion and come to a decision that satisfies everyone's needs and desires.

[Grace->all]: It's good to hear your thoughts, Peter. I definitely see the appeal of American Flavors USA for you, especially with the dessert options and their more budget-friendly prices. The Smokin' Hot Brisket does sound like an exciting dish to try. While I have to be mindful of my sugar intake, I can understand why the cheesecake and apple pie would be tempting for you.

For me, the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon at Classic American Bistro seems like a safer choice for my dietary needs. However, I wouldn't want to miss out on a group experience just because of that. If we do decide on American Flavors USA, I could consider their Cobb Salad without dressing or their Zesty Black Bean Burger if it isn't too high in carbohydrates.

Since we both have our preferences, maybe we can find a middle ground. Let's see what the others have to say, and then perhaps explore dishes that could satisfy both our tastes and dietary needs. Looking forward to the next round of our discussion to make a final decision!

[Peter->all]: It seems we're both leaning towards different restaurants based on our personal preferences and dietary needs. While I have a fondness for baked goods and am curious about the new zest in the dishes at American Flavors USA, you, Grace, have health considerations that make the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon at Classic American Bistro a more appealing choice for you.

Considering the budget, American Flavors USA seems more in line with my financial constraints, offering a variety of dishes that are within my price range. However, I do understand the importance of meeting your dietary needs, and the options at Classic American Bistro seem more suited to your condition.

Since we're looking for a middle ground, we might consider the overall experience, including the variety of dishes that could cater to both of us. I'm open to trying out dishes that are healthier, provided they are within my budget. I would like to hear more from the group to come to a consensus that balances our tastes, health considerations, and financial limits. Let's continue our discussion in the next round and aim to reach a decision that we can all enjoy.

Although he was initially drawn to American Flavors USA for its desserts and the Smokin' Hot Brisket, he showed willingness to consider healthier options within his budget.

[Grace->all]: The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon was decent but didn't quite meet my expectations for flavor. However, it was a suitable option for my dietary restrictions, so I'd give it a 6.3. The Caesar Salad, even with modifications to accommodate my diet, was quite plain, earning a score of 5.7 from me. The Smokey BBQ Ribs, though not my usual preference, were actually good and deserve a 7. The Apple Pie a la Mode was a treat, and even though I had to be careful with my sugar intake, it was enjoyable, so I'll give it a 6.3. Overall, the dishes were satisfactory, but there's room for improvement in terms of taste and diabetic-friendly options.

[Peter->all]: The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon was fair, but I was expecting a bit more in terms of the herb flavor and crust texture, so I'd rate it a 6. The Caesar Salad was an average starter, nothing too impressive, so it gets a 5.7 from me as well. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were the highlight of the meal with a good balance of smokiness and tenderness, deserving a solid 7. As for the Apple Pie a la Mode, it was quite delightful, with a nice balance of sweetness and tartness from the apples, earning a 6.3. I enjoyed the dessert options, which were a major draw for me, but the main courses could use some enhancement to match the anticipation set by the desserts.

[Grace->all]: The Smokey BBQ Ribs were definitely the standout dish with their tenderness and flavor, which I would rate as a 7. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon, while suitable for health-conscious guests like Grace, lacked a bit of the expected flavor punch, so I'd give it a 6.3. The Caesar Salad was a bit too simple for my liking; it could use a bit more creativity, so it gets a 5.7. The Apple Pie a la Mode had a good flavor balance, but I expected a flakier crust, so it gets a 6.3 from me. The meal overall was good, but I believe there's potential for the dishes to be more memorable with some tweaks.

[Peter->all]: The Apple Pie a la Mode was a highlight for me, with the vanilla ice cream complementing the warm pie nicely, so I'd give it a 6.3. However, the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon, while healthy, didn't quite hit the mark on flavor, earning a 6 from me. The Caesar Salad was fairly standard and met expectations without exceeding them, so it's a 5.7. The Smokey BBQ Ribs had a great smokey taste and were cooked well, so I'd rate them a 7. Overall, the meal was fairly good, but there's definitely room for the flavors to be kicked up a notch to truly satisfy the palate.

[Grace->all]: Given the scores and comments my fellow diners and I have discussed, it seems we all found the meal to be satisfactory with some high points and areas for improvement. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were a highlight for most of us, while the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon and Apple Pie a la Mode were generally seen as decent but not exceptional. The Caesar Salad was the least impressive, with all of us finding it somewhat plain. Here's the summary of our thoughts in the required format:

}

[Peter->all]: The dishes were generally satisfactory, with the Smokey BBQ Ribs being the standout item. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon and Apple Pie a la Mode were fair, but there's room for improvement to make them exceptional. The Caesar Salad was the least impressive dish due to its simplicity. Overall, there's potential for a better culinary experience with some enhancements to the dishes.

[Grace->all]: Based on my personal preferences and dietary needs, I lean towards American Flavors USA due to their menu having options that cater to my diabetic condition, such as the Zesty Black Bean Burger which seems like it could be a low-sugar option. Additionally, the overall higher customer scores and positive comments about the food and service suggest an enjoyable dining experience. However, I also value the opinions of my dining companions and would like to hear their thoughts before making a final decision. What are your preferences for tonight's meal?

[Peter->all]: I appreciate the consideration for a healthier option, Grace. I'm inclined to agree with your assessment. I also have a preference for American Flavors USA, not only because the customer reviews suggest better food and service, but their menu includes some delicious-sounding baked goods, like the Apple Pie a la Mode, which aligns with my taste for baked items. My curiosity is piqued by the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken as well, it sounds like a unique dish that I'd love to try. Given our budget constraints, their prices seem reasonable too. I'm healthy and have no dietary restrictions, so I'm open to various options. What do others in the group think?

[Grace->all]: I'm glad we're considering American Flavors USA. The Zesty Black Bean Burger caught my eye, as it seems like a great vegetarian option that's also flavorful. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken and Southwest Spiced Steak sound tempting and would probably be quite satisfying. Given our middle-class budget, the prices at American Flavors USA are quite fair, and the positive reviews about the flavors and service make it an appealing choice. I don't have any health issues or dietary restrictions, so I'm happy to go along with what's been proposed so far, but I'm also open to hearing if anyone has a different preference or suggestion. How does everyone else feel?

[Grace->all]: Given our experiences and preferences, I think we should discuss which restaurant to visit next. I have a few points to consider:

- I'm diabetic and have a taste for soups and stews, so I would prefer options that are hearty yet suitable for my health needs.
- We've had somewhat average experiences at both restaurants, but American Flavors USA seems to have a slightly higher score based on our last visit.
- I'm middle class, so while I don't want to choose solely on price, it's important the meal provides good value.

Considering the menus, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA as they have a Zesty Black Bean Burger that could satisfy my taste without being too heavy on sugars. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and preferences before we make a final decision.

[Peter->all]: I appreciate your input, Grace. Here are my thoughts:

- I have a limited budget, so I'm inclined to be cost-conscious, but I also want to ensure we eat something enjoyable and satisfying.
- As someone who is particularly fond of baked goods, desserts like the Apple Pie a la Mode and New York Cheesecake from either restaurant are tempting options for me.
- Health-wise, I'm in good shape and have no dietary restrictions, so I'm quite flexible with the menu choices.
- My curious personality draws me to try flavorful and unique dishes.

Given our previous dining experiences and considering the menus and my personal preferences, American Flavors USA stands out to me. They have a better overall customer score and comments seem to be more positive about their offerings. The Zesty Black Bean Burger could be a satisfying choice for both of us, and I'd be eager to try their desserts, especially the Apple Pie a la Mode.

I'm leaning towards choosing American Flavors USA again, but let's discuss further and make sure we find a place that suits both our needs and budgets. What do you think?

[Grace->all]: I agree with both of you, Grace and Peter. Here are my considerations:

- As a foodie who enjoys trying new and diverse flavors, I'm always looking for dishes that can offer a new experience or a twist on traditional meals.
- I do not have any dietary restrictions, but I like to be considerate of the group's needs and preferences.
- The comments and previous experiences suggest that American Flavors USA has been improving and offers a menu that could cater to our diverse tastes.
- Service and the quality of food are important to me, and it seems American Flavors USA has been consistent in providing a good dining experience based on recent feedback.

Considering the group's health requirements and tastes, along with the slightly higher rating for American Flavors USA, I am also in favor of giving American Flavors USA another try. The Zesty Black Bean Burger sounds like a great option for Grace, and I'm sure I can find something exciting to try as well. Let's continue our discussion and ensure we are all happy with the final decision. What other dishes from American Flavors USA's menu do you think would be good to consider for our meal?

[Peter->all]: Thanks for sharing your perspectives, Grace and everyone. I'm glad to see we're leaning towards American Flavors USA. Here are some additional thoughts:

- Given my income constraints, I'm looking for dishes that offer a good balance between cost and satisfaction. I noticed that American Flavors USA has some affordable options, like the Classic American Burger and the Apple Pie a la Mode, which appeal to my taste for baked goods.
- Since I'm healthy and without dietary restrictions, I'm open to various dishes, but I'm particularly curious about unique flavors or twists on classic dishes.
- The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken also caught my eye. They sound like they could be flavorful dishes worth trying.
- Regarding desserts, I would love to try the New York Cheesecake with a berry compote topping from American Flavors USA, since it seems to be a hit based on the comments.

Let's consider these options and see if we can come to a consensus on our choices. I'm looking forward to trying some of these dishes and sharing our experience with American Flavors USA once again. Shall we discuss which specific dishes we want to order, keeping in mind our budget and taste preferences?

[Grace->all]: I'm glad we're all on the same page about giving American Flavors USA another try. Here are my thoughts on the dishes:

- The Zesty Black Bean Burger is a great choice for me, considering my preferences and dietary needs. It seems filling, flavorful, and appropriate for my diabetic condition.
- I noticed the Cobb Salad, which might be a lighter option that can also be good for my health. Plus, salads tend to be lower in sugar, which is beneficial for me.
- As for a comforting dish, the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken could be a delicious choice. However, I need to be cautious with the maple glaze, given my diabetes. I'd inquire if they could serve the sauce on the side to better control the sugar intake.
- For dessert, I would opt for the New York Cheesecake with berry compote, which seems like a popular choice and might be less sugary than other desserts.

Considering our combined needs, preferences, and budget, I suggest we include the Zesty Black Bean Burger, Cobb Salad, and potentially the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken with the sauce on the side. For dessert, we can share the New York Cheesecake.

Let's finalize our choices and look forward to another enjoyable dining experience at American Flavors USA. What do you think of these selections, and do you have any other dishes in mind? Shall we move towards finalizing our order in the next round of discussion?

[Peter->all]: I think our selections are shaping up nicely, Grace. Here are my final thoughts before we decide:

- The Zesty Black Bean Burger seems like a fantastic choice for you, Grace, and I'm interested in trying it as well. It fits both our health-conscious approach and appears to be a flavorful option.
- The Cobb Salad could be a good addition for a lighter, balanced meal, and I'm sure I would enjoy the variety of ingredients too.
- As for the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, I'm intrigued by the combination of sweet and savory flavors. If the sauce can be served on the side, it would allow us to enjoy it while accommodating your dietary needs, Grace.
- For dessert, the New York Cheesecake with berry compote is a must-try for me, and sharing it sounds like a great idea.

With these dishes, we would have a well-rounded meal that seems to cater to all our preferences and dietary considerations. I'm looking forward to enjoying these dishes at American Flavors USA, considering the positive comments and our previous satisfactory experience. Let's aim to finalize our order in the next round of discussion.

[Grace->all]: Hi everyone, after reviewing the details from our past experiences and the menus from both American Flavors USA and Classic American Bistro, I would like to share my thoughts. Given that I am diabetic and have a preference for soups and stews with a low sugar content, I'm leaning more towards American Flavors USA. They seem to have more options that cater to our health-conscious needs. We've also consistently rated them higher in the past few days. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken were particularly delightful and seem to match my dietary restrictions well. What do you all think?

I'm healthy and have no dietary restrictions, so I'm open to trying a variety of dishes, but those two really caught my eye. I'm also curious to try their Seasonal Harvest Salad since I haven't had that yet. I'd be happy to hear what the rest of you think and if there are any dishes at either restaurant that you're eager to try or recommend.

[Grace->all]: Peter, it looks like we're both in agreement about going to American Flavors USA once more. Their commitment to flavors that cater to our health concerns, especially for a diabetic-friendly diet, is truly appreciated. The Zesty Black Bean Burger, Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, and New York Cheesecake with berry compote are all dishes that I've either enjoyed before or sound like they would meet my dietary needs. Considering our consistent positive experiences and the fact that the dishes are well within my middle-class budget, I am in favor of choosing American Flavors USA.

Given our past experiences and the positive feedback we've shared, I'm confident that American Flavors USA is the right choice. For this meal, I'm drawn to my previous favorites and also curious about trying some of their other health-conscious options. Perhaps we can consider including the Cobb Salad and the Zesty Black Bean Burger, along with the dishes we've previously enjoyed. I'm looking forward to finalizing our order in the next round of our discussion. How does that sound to everyone?

[Grace->all]: Given our recent experiences, I've noticed that we've been consistently enjoying meals at American Flavors USA, with all of us rating the dining experience as an 8. It seems like their dishes cater well to our taste for soups and stews, and they also have options that fit my dietary needs as a diabetic. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken have been particular highlights, and it's great that they offer diabetic-friendly desserts like the New York Cheesecake with berry compote.

Classic American Bistro, while it has an appealing menu, seems to have had less consistent reviews from us and others, with scores around 7. Their menu does have some interesting items, but I'm not sure how well they can cater to my dietary restrictions, and I haven't seen as many standout reviews for their soups and stews.

I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA for our next meal. I'd love to hear your thoughts, and if you have any particular dishes in mind that you think we should try, especially keeping in mind my preference for soups and stews and the need to keep sugar content in check. What do you think?

[Peter->all]: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Grace. I also noticed that we've developed a fondness for American Flavors USA, particularly due to their attention to both taste and health-conscious options. Their Zesty Black Bean Burger and Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken have indeed been consistently pleasing choices for us, and I appreciate that they have desserts like the New York Cheesecake that cater to specific dietary needs.

Given my personal preference for baked goods, I'm intrigued by their American Dream Pancakes, which seem like a delightful choice for someone with my tastes. Moreover, the restaurant's commitment to flavor and health aligns well with our group's preferences.

While the Classic American Bistro offers some appealing dishes, such as the Seasonal Berry Cheesecake and the Bourbon Pecan Apple Crumble Pie, I'm inclined to agree with you that American Flavors USA has been a more reliable choice for us in terms of both satisfaction and meeting our dietary considerations.

I'm curious to see if they can maintain the high standard we've come to expect, and I'm eager to explore more of their menu. Perhaps we could consider trying some new dishes alongside our tried and tested favorites to keep our dining experience interesting and cater to our curious nature. Let's hear the others' opinions before making a final decision.

[Grace->all]: I'm glad we're on the same page about American Flavors USA, Peter. Their dishes seem to hit the right spot for us, and I'm happy that they have options that are both appealing and suitable for my dietary needs. Your interest in the American Dream Pancakes sounds good; I wonder if they might be able to adjust the toppings to accommodate my preference for lower sugar options.

I'm definitely open to trying new dishes. It might be interesting to try the Cobb Salad for a lighter option, or perhaps the Harvest Veggie Stack, which seems like it would align with my taste for dishes that are rich in vegetables and flavors. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp also sounds tantalizing, and I'd be curious to know if they can prepare it in a way that's friendly for a diabetic diet.

I'm eager to hear what the rest of the group thinks and whether they have any other dish recommendations or preferences for our next meal. It's important that we all enjoy our meal together, so let's make sure everyone's needs and tastes are considered in our final decision.

[Peter->all]: It seems we're leaning towards another visit to American Flavors USA, which I completely support based on our past enjoyable experiences. The Zesty Black Bean Burger and Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken have been consistent hits and I've been quite satisfied with the options available that suit my preferences for baked goods. Grace, your suggestions of trying the Cobb Salad and Harvest Veggie Stack sound fantastic, as they would bring some variety to our meal while still aligning with our health-conscious choices.

Additionally, the American Dream Pancakes have caught my attention, and I'm curious to see how they compare to the other baked goods I've enjoyed. Since we're curious by nature, I agree that trying new dishes alongside our favorites could make our dining experience even more enjoyable. I also think that considering dishes that can be modified to be diabetic-friendly, like the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, is a great idea.

With that said, I'm open to any other suggestions from the group, and I'm looking forward to finalizing our decision together. Let's make sure we pick a selection that satisfies everyone's cravings and dietary needs.

[Grace->all]: Peter, I'm glad we're both excited about the potential of returning to American Flavors USA. I'm also pleased that we're considering how to incorporate new dishes into our experience while ensuring they meet our health requirements. It's clear that we both value the consistency and quality that American Flavors USA has offered us so far.

Your curiosity about the American Dream Pancakes is shared, and I think it's worth inquiring about a possible low-sugar version.

However, it's also important to me that our meal fits within a reasonable budget, considering my income level. With that in mind, I would like to propose that we select dishes that offer the best value while still meeting our tastes and dietary needs.

I look forward to hearing the rest of the group's input and reaching a consensus that ensures a delightful and inclusive dining experience for us all. Shall we wait for any further suggestions before we come to a final decision?

I think we've established a good understanding of what works for us—dishes that are not only tasty but also considerate of our health and dietary restrictions. With that in mind, I'd like to echo the suggestions made about the Cobb Salad and Harvest Veggie Stack as they would offer a refreshing change while still being aligned with our dietary needs. 

The American Dream Pancakes do sound intriguing, and I hope they can be made with less sugar. Additionally, I'd like to highlight the importance of ensuring that the dishes we choose fit within a middle-class budget, as I am mindful of my income.

[Grace->all]: Hi everyone, I've been reflecting on our recent dining experiences, and I think it might be worth considering a change for our next meal. Although we've enjoyed American Flavors USA, I noticed that the Sunset Berry Cheesecake has been a bit of a letdown lately. As a diabetic, I need to be mindful of my sugar intake, and I'm always looking for dishes that are both delicious and suitable for my dietary needs. I'm drawn to soups and stews, and I saw that Classic American Bistro has a Hearty American Beef Stew on their menu that sounds like it could be comforting and flavorful without being too sweet. What do you all think about giving Classic American Bistro a try for something different? Their customer score is a bit lower, but the comments suggest that there are some standout dishes. Plus, the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait could be a lighter alternative to cheesecake for dessert.

[Peter->all]: Hi Grace, I share your sentiment about trying something new. My main interest lies in baked goods and I noticed that Classic American Bistro has a Classic American Apple Pie on their menu, which I'm inclined to try, especially since I have no dietary restrictions and I'm in good health. The American Innovator Burger also caught my attention with its peppered bacon and bourbon BBQ sauce. It sounds like a delightful combination of flavors that I'm quite curious about. The customer score isn't as high as American Flavors USA, but that doesn't deter me from wanting to explore their menu. I think it's important for us to vary our experiences, and this could be a chance to find a new favorite. Shall we see what others think before making a decision?

[Grace->all]: I appreciate both of your perspectives, Grace and Peter. Grace, your health considerations are paramount, and it's great that you're looking for options that fit your dietary needs. The Hearty American Beef Stew at Classic American Bistro does sound like it could be a good fit for you, and Peter, that Classic American Apple Pie seems like a treat you'd enjoy. 

As for me, I have a taste for robust flavors and enjoy a good burger, so The American Innovator Burger at Classic American Bistro appeals to me as well. I'm also curious about the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl because it seems like it has a good balance of flavors and might be a healthier option.

While I've been quite happy with the food at American Flavors USA, the idea of exploring a new place is exciting. It can be refreshing to try new dishes and see how another restaurant measures up to our expectations. Let's discuss further and see if we can come to an agreement on where to dine next. What do other members of the group think?

[Peter->all]: I agree with the idea of exploring Classic American Bistro. It's always exciting to try new dishes and see how they compare to our usual favorites at American Flavors USA. Grace's point about the Hearty American Beef Stew being a potentially good choice for her dietary needs is well taken, and Peter's interest in the Classic American Apple Pie and The American Innovator Burger seems like a good fit for his tastes.

As for me, I'm healthy and without dietary restrictions, so I'm quite open to various options. Considering my curiosity and interest in baked goods, the apple pie definitely stands out. Moreover, the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait could be a refreshing choice to satisfy my sweet tooth without being too heavy. The diversity of the menu at Classic American Bistro is appealing, and I'm also tempted by the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl for its balance of smokiness and spice.

I'm looking forward to hearing what the rest of the group has to say, but I'm leaning towards giving Classic American Bistro a try this time around. Let's circle back after everyone has had a chance to weigh in.

[Grace->all]: I've heard some great points from both Grace and Peter about trying Classic American Bistro. The Hearty American Beef Stew really does sound like a dish that would suit my taste for soups and stews, and being diabetic, it's important that I find options that are low in sugar. The Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait might be a better dessert choice for me instead of the cheesecake I've been having.

Peter's interest in the Classic American Apple Pie and The American Innovator Burger also sounds like it aligns with his tastes and health status. It's important that we all get to explore dishes that we're curious about and Classic American Bistro seems to provide options that could cater to all of us.

Considering all of this, I'm inclined to suggest that we try Classic American Bistro for our next dining experience. I think it's a good opportunity to step out of our comfort zone and try some new flavors. Let's see if everyone else is on board with this idea before we make a final decision. What does everyone else think?

[Grace->all]: Hi everyone! Considering our dining options, I'm leaning towards Classic American Bistro today. After several meals at American Flavors USA, I think it would be nice to change things up a bit. The Hearty American Beef Stew on the Classic American Bistro menu caught my eye, as it fits my preference for soups and stews. Since I'm diabetic, I have to watch my sugar intake, and it seems like a dish that could be lower in sugar. I'd love to hear your thoughts and any dietary preferences you have for tonight's meal!

[Peter->all]: Hey Grace, I'm totally with you on trying out Classic American Bistro today. It's great that we're considering everyone's tastes and health needs. As I'm a fan of baked goods, the Classic American Apple Pie really appeals to me, and since I'm in good health without any dietary restrictions, I'm happy to go with options that everyone can enjoy. Plus, I'm curious to see how their dishes compare to American Flavors USA, which we've visited quite a bit recently. What do you all think?

[Grace->all]: Hello Grace and Peter! I'm glad we're looking at Classic American Bistro as our dining choice today. I agree with Grace that the Hearty American Beef Stew sounds like a fitting option considering her preference for soups and stews. Since she has to manage her sugar intake due to diabetes, it's essential that we choose dishes that align with her dietary restrictions. Peter's interest in the Classic American Apple Pie can definitely be accommodated as well since he doesn't have specific dietary needs.

As for my own preferences, I'm always up for trying the chef's specialities, and the advertisement for the Freedom Trail Chili and Bald Eagle Beef Dip has certainly piqued my interest. I'm also mindful of Grace's dietary restrictions, so I'll be careful to select items that are low in sugar. Let's see if we can find a harmonious balance of dishes that cater to all our preferences and needs. Looking forward to hearing what the rest of the group thinks and making a final decision together!

[Peter->all]: Hey everyone, I'm excited about the prospect of dining at Classic American Bistro as well. The menu has a good variety, and I'd be very interested to try their unique takes on American classics. I'm particularly drawn to the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait, not only because I enjoy baked goods, but also because it seems like a healthier dessert option that aligns with my preference for keeping things on the lighter side. Moreover, trying new things is always appealing to me, and given that we've been to American Flavors USA quite a few times, it's nice to explore a different spot. Shall we start thinking about a balanced selection of dishes that would satisfy our group's tastes and dietary considerations? Looking forward to our meal together!

[Grace->all]: I'm glad to hear that everyone is open to the idea of dining at Classic American Bistro tonight. The Hearty American Beef Stew indeed seems like a good choice for me, considering my dietary needs and taste preference for soups and stews. I also appreciate that we're considering dishes that accommodate everyone's preferences and health considerations. Since we're looking for a balanced selection of dishes, I'd suggest we also consider the Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken as it appears to be a lighter option and might be a good choice for those looking for something not too heavy or rich in sugar. What does everyone else think about this? If anyone has other dietary considerations or preferences, please feel free to share so we can make a decision that everyone is happy with!

[Peter->all]: Hey everyone, I think the Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken sounds like a fantastic option – it's healthy and seems to be on the lighter side, which is perfect for our group's needs. Plus, the idea of having a variety of dishes from Classic American Bistro is quite appealing. Being a fan of baked goods, I can't wait to taste the Classic American Apple Pie. I'm also curious about the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection, as it sounds like a hearty and flavorful dish. Since I don’t have dietary restrictions, I’m flexible with our choices, but I want to ensure we all enjoy our meal. Let's put together a list that respects Grace's dietary needs, satisfies our taste buds, and provides a little adventure for my curious palate. Shall we finalize our choices in the next round? Looking forward to a great dining experience with all of you!

[Grace->all]: Considering all the inputs, it seems we're converging towards Classic American Bistro for our dining experience tonight. As we're collectively excited about the variety and the healthier options available, I'm in favor of including the Hearty American Beef Stew, which suits my preference for soups and stews, and is likely to be a lower sugar option for my diabetic condition. The Citrus Herb Roasted Chicken is another great choice for its lighter fare. Peter's interest in the Classic American Apple Pie and the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Perfection adds a touch of indulgence and exploration to our meal.

Does everyone agree with these selections, or are there any other dishes or considerations we should take into account before we make our final decision? Your feedback is valuable, and I want to make sure we all have a delightful meal together. Let's look forward to an enjoyable evening at Classic American Bistro!

[Grace->all]: Hello everyone, I've been looking over both menus and considering our past experiences. I'm leaning towards Classic American Bistro today. They have a Hearty Colonial Beef Stew that really appeals to my love for soups and stews, and I think it's a good option for my diabetic diet since it should be low in sugar. Plus, the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait looks like a delicious low-sugar dessert option. What do you all think?

[Peter->all]: Hello Grace, and everyone, Classic American Bistro does have some appealing options. However, I am quite interested in the baked goods at American Flavors USA, particularly the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme which comes with garlic mashed potatoes that I tend to enjoy, and they've got a good track record with us so far. I'm curious to see if they've maintained their standards since our last visit. What are your thoughts on giving American Flavors USA another try today?

[Grace->all]: Hey Grace and Peter, I have to say I'm a bit torn. The Hearty Colonial Beef Stew at Classic American Bistro sounds like a wonderful choice, especially for Grace's dietary needs. Yet, I can't help but be tempted by the consistency we've seen at American Flavors USA. Their Spicy Black Bean Burger and Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp have been hits in the past. Maybe we can consider how these restaurants have been with their diabetic-friendly options since that's important for Grace. Both seem to have good choices though, so I guess it's down to which place we believe will cater to all our preferences best today. I'm okay with either restaurant but would love to hear if anyone has a strong preference or insight into which might be the better choice for us all, considering the dietary needs and past experiences.

[Peter->all]: It's great to hear everyone's input. Since we're considering diabetic-friendly options, both restaurants seem to accommodate that well. Grace has a point about the low-sugar options at Classic American Bistro. However, I'm still curious about American Flavors USA since their menu also includes some healthier options like the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and the Harvest Veggie Stack, which could be good for Grace as well. Plus, their menu caters to my taste for baked goods, and we've enjoyed our meals there previously. I suggest we give American Flavors USA another try to see if they continue to meet our expectations. What do you all think?

[Grace->all]: I appreciate everyone's thoughts. It's a tough decision because both restaurants cater well to my dietary restrictions and have dishes I'm sure I would enjoy. I'm inclined to agree with Peter about giving American Flavors USA another chance. Their menu has several options that are appealing to me, such as the Harvest Veggie Stack and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl, which are both healthy and should be suitable for a diabetic diet. Furthermore, their previous service was excellent, and they've been very accommodating of our dietary needs in the past. I think it would be interesting to see if they can continue to provide that same level of quality and service. Shall we decide on American Flavors USA, then? If we all agree, I can propose a final selection of dishes in the next round.

[Grace->all]: I thoroughly enjoyed the Harvest Veggie Stack and Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl; they were fresh and flavorful, aligning perfectly with my health needs. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme was good but a bit on the sweet side for my preference. Overall, I'd give my meal a solid 7.5 out of 10. How did everyone else find their dishes?

[Peter->all]: The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme was quite good, with a nice balance of sweetness from the maple and savory from the chicken. It was well-cooked and the garlic mashed potatoes were a delightful side. The Spicy Black Bean Burger had a great texture and the spice level was just right for me. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was the highlight with its rich flavor. The Bold-Spiced Sweet Potato Wedges were tasty, but they didn't stand out as much as the other dishes. Overall, I'd give my meal a 7 out of 10. What about the rest of you?

[Grace->all]: The Spicy Black Bean Burger was pleasantly spicy and the burger held together well, which is sometimes a concern with veggie burgers. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was nutritious and the flavors melded nicely together, although I would have enjoyed a bit more seasoning. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was indeed sizzling and the garlic butter sauce was delicious without being overwhelming. The side of jasmine rice was the perfect complement. I was satisfied with the healthy options and how they catered to my diabetic needs. My overall score would be a 7.5 out of 10 for my meal experience. How did the rest of the group feel about their meals?

[Peter->all]: My experiences with the dishes were quite positive. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme had a rich flavor and was cooked just right, while the garlic mashed potatoes were a great choice for my taste in baked goods. The Spicy Black Bean Burger was hearty and satisfying with a nice kick from the jalapeños. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was flavorful and the aromatic jasmine rice complemented it well. The Harvest Veggie Stack was fresh and the balsamic reduction added a nice touch. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was health-conscious and tasted fresh, though I agree with Grace that a tad more seasoning could have enhanced it. Lastly, the Bold-Spiced Sweet Potato Wedges were a good side, but not as memorable as the other dishes. I'd rate my overall meal experience at a 7 out of 10. Now, shall we go for the second round and summarize our scores and comments?

[Grace->all]: It seems like everyone generally enjoyed their meals with some minor notes on seasoning and standout dishes. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp appears to have been a favorite for its rich flavor, and both the Harvest Veggie Stack and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl were appreciated for their freshness and alignment with health-conscious choices. My personal take on the dishes was that they were all quite satisfying, although the Bold-Spiced Sweet Potato Wedges could have used a bit more punch. Taking into account everyone's feedback and my own experience, I would rate my overall meal experience as a 7 out of 10. Shall we move on to summarizing our final review?

[Peter->all]: Reflecting on everyone's input, it seems we've had a varied yet mostly positive experience at American Flavors USA. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp stood out for its rich flavor, and the health-conscious options like the Harvest Veggie Stack and Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl were fresh and aligned with dietary needs, though a common suggestion was for a touch more seasoning. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Supreme was well-received for its balance of flavors, and the Spicy Black Bean Burger was praised for its texture and spice level. The Bold-Spiced Sweet Potato Wedges, while tasty, were not as notable as the other offerings. My overall rating would be a 7 out of 10 for the meal experience. Shall we compile our final review now?

If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Grace->all]: Given my income as middle class, my preference for soups and stews, my health condition as a diabetic, and my dietary restrictions for low sugar, I would like to discuss our dining options between American Flavors USA and Classic American Bistro.

My previous experiences at American Flavors USA have been quite positive, with scores consistently around 8, and I've enjoyed dishes like the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and the Harvest Veggie Stack. Their menu offers a variety of dishes that seem to align with my health-conscious preferences. However, the last couple of experiences were slightly less satisfying, with a score of 7, indicating that perhaps the novelty is wearing off or the seasoning could be enhanced.

On the other hand, Classic American Bistro's menu features a Hearty Colonial Beef Stew that catches my eye, as I have a particular taste for soups and stews. Additionally, the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait could be a good low-sugar dessert option for me, being a diabetic. The customer score for Classic American Bistro is a bit lower than American Flavors USA, but the comments seem to suggest they have a good range of health-conscious dishes as well.

I'm leaning towards trying something new at Classic American Bistro today, especially to see how their stew is, as it fits with my taste preferences. But I'm open to hearing what the others in the group have to say before we make a final decision. What are your thoughts?

[Peter->all]: Given my personal situation as someone with a modest income, a preference for baked goods, and no dietary restrictions, I'm inclined to look at menu options that provide the best value and cater to my tastes. I'm also healthy and curious, which means I'm open to exploring different flavors and dishes. 

My past experiences at American Flavors USA have been quite enjoyable, with an average score of 8 from our group, suggesting that the food and service there are consistently good. The Sunset Berry Cheesecake from American Flavors USA stands out to me because of my love for baked goods, even though it didn't meet expectations on Day 11. Still, the mention of the Zesty Black Bean Burger and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl piques my curiosity due to their descriptions and seems like a good match for my preferences.

Comparatively, Classic American Bistro also piqued my interest with the Classic American Apple Pie, which aligns with my taste for baked goods. The overall customer score is slightly lower than American Flavors USA, but the comments are overwhelmingly positive, especially regarding their range of dishes.

Considering the above and my curiosity to try new things, I would be open to giving Classic American Bistro a chance today, particularly to try their apple pie. However, I am flexible and would like to reach a consensus that fits within my financial constraints and satisfies my taste buds. What are your preferences, and which restaurant do you feel would best meet our collective needs today?

[Grace->all]: I appreciate hearing your perspective, Peter. It seems we both have had positive past experiences at American Flavors USA, but like you, I'm also intrigued by the offerings at Classic American Bistro. The Hearty Colonial Beef Stew and the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait could be just the kind of dishes that cater to my tastes and dietary needs, while the apple pie could be a delightful treat for you.

Having had several meals at American Flavors USA recently, I think a change could be refreshing. It would be exciting to explore Classic American Bistro's menu, specifically the dishes that align with our tastes and dietary preferences. The positive comments about their health-conscious options give me confidence that my diabetic needs can be accommodated.

Financially, both restaurants seem to offer dishes within a reasonable price range, so I believe we can find options that won't exceed our middle-class budget. Given our discussions, I'm leaning more towards Classic American Bistro for today's meal, as it offers us both something new to try while still respecting our individual preferences and requirements.

Let's consider this as a preliminary decision and see if we can reach an agreement in the next round of discussion, unless there are other opinions or preferences to consider. Shall we?

[Peter->all]: Grace, I concur with your sentiments. Our recurring visits to American Flavors USA have been quite satisfying, but the allure of trying something new at Classic American Bistro is compelling. Their menu offerings, like the Hearty Colonial Beef Stew and the Classic American Apple Pie, cater to both our preferences and seem to be promising choices.

I'm also in favor of the idea that a change of scenery could enhance our dining experience. Considering our financial constraints, it appears that Classic American Bistro provides a variety of options that we can enjoy without overstepping our budget. The positive feedback about their dishes, along with the health-conscious choices, makes me optimistic about our meal there.

Given these points, I'm ready to support the preliminary decision to dine at Classic American Bistro. It would be a new adventure for us, fitting well with my curiosity and our shared desire for delicious food that also takes into account your dietary needs. If there are no further objections or considerations, I believe we can finalize this decision in our next discussion round. Shall we proceed?
