[Amelia->all]: Given my preference for Mexican food, neither Classic American Bistro nor American Flavors USA directly caters to my preferred cuisine. However, I'm open to trying different foods and enjoy a spirited atmosphere with high-quality ingredients and great service.

Looking at the menus, both restaurants offer classic American dishes with similar items like BBQ ribs, cheesecakes, and burgers, which can be quite satisfying. Classic American Bistro seems to put a slight emphasis on a richer description of their dishes and a more premium price point, which could indicate a higher quality or larger portions. The Smokey BBQ Ribs and New York Cheesecake catch my eye here for their classic flavors.

On the other hand, American Flavors USA has a more affordable price point which might be better suited for my middle-class income, and I'm intrigued by the Philly Cheesesteak and the Fried Chicken Basket, which could be comforting and delicious choices.

Given these considerations and since I'm healthy with no dietary restrictions, I'd lean towards trying American Flavors USA for their more budget-friendly options that still promise a taste of classic Americana. Plus, their Pulled Pork Sandwich and Mac & Cheese sound delightful and would likely satisfy my spirited personality with their comforting and hearty flavors.

I would be interested to hear what others think and if they have any preferences based on their dietary needs or taste preferences. We can then make a decision together that suits everyone's needs and desires.

[Lara->all]: As an ambitious individual with a middle-class income, my focus is on a dining experience that offers both quality and value. My taste leans towards seafood, so I'm naturally drawn to dishes that feature fish or shellfish as their main component. Fortunately, both restaurants have seafood options, but Classic American Bistro has a Grilled Salmon that catches my eye. Given my healthy condition and lack of dietary restrictions, I'm open to a variety of options from the menu.

While the affordability of American Flavors USA is appealing, the richer description of the Grilled Salmon at Classic American Bistro suggests a potentially more delicious and high-quality meal. This aligns with my ambitious personality, as I tend to seek out the best possible options rather than just the most cost-effective ones. Additionally, the fact that Classic American Bistro lists a specific type of cheesecake – New York Cheesecake – with a fruit coulis is tempting, considering my penchant for well-crafted desserts.

I'm curious to know what the other members of our group think and whether they have specific preferences or requirements we should consider. Once we've all shared our thoughts, we can move towards a decision that satisfies everyone's taste and provides a delightful culinary experience.

[Iris->all]: Given my preferences and characteristics, I am inclined towards options that are healthy, budget-friendly, and gentle on the palate. Salads are my preferred choice, so I'm naturally drawn to menu items that reflect my love for fresher, lighter meals.

Between Classic American Bistro and American Flavors USA, both offer a salad option. However, the Caesar Salad from Classic American Bistro appeals less to me because it is a heavier salad with a creamy dressing and parmesan. On the other hand, the Cobb Salad from American Flavors USA, with mixed greens, grilled chicken, and avocado, seems like a fresher option that would cater to my health-consciousness and preference for salads. Moreover, given my financial situation, the more affordable prices at American Flavors USA are a decisive factor for me.

I also appreciate the fact that the menus cater to a variety of tastes without restrictions, which suits my gentle personality and allows for a more inclusive dining experience should others have specific dietary needs. 

I'd love to hear more from the rest of the group to ensure that the final decision accommodates everyone's preferences and needs. I'm open to discussion and willing to consider other options if they align more closely with the group's overall desires.

[Amelia->all]: Considering the input from the group, I think it's important to balance quality, taste preferences, and budget. While I have a preference for Mexican food, I'm open to exploring American cuisine, and both restaurants offer a variety of dishes that could be quite enjoyable.

Lara has a penchant for seafood and high-quality meals, which could be met by the Grilled Salmon at Classic American Bistro. However, Iris prefers a lighter fare, favoring the Cobb Salad from American Flavors USA for its fresher ingredients and compatibility with her health-conscious lifestyle.

Taking into account the diverse tastes of our group and combining that with the need for budget-friendly options, I am now leaning towards American Flavors USA. Their menu items such as the Pulled Pork Sandwich, Mac & Cheese, and Cobb Salad offer a mix of hearty and healthy choices that should satisfy our different tastes while also being considerate of our middle-class income bracket.

Since American Flavors USA seems to meet the group's needs both in terms of financial practicality and culinary preferences, I propose that we choose this restaurant. If everyone agrees with this preliminary decision, we can finalize it in the next round of discussion.

So, Lara and Iris, what are your thoughts on choosing American Flavors USA based on our discussion? If we have consensus, I can summarize our decision in the next message.

[Lara->all]: Reflecting on the discussion, it's clear that we are looking for a place that offers a balance of quality, taste, and affordability. Although I have a slight preference for the Grilled Salmon at Classic American Bistro, I understand the importance of accommodating everyone's preferences and budget considerations.

Amelia and Iris have both expressed a preference for American Flavors USA, which offers a range of dishes that seem to appeal to our varying tastes while also being more budget-friendly. The Cobb Salad would suit Iris's preference for a healthy and lighter meal, the Pulled Pork Sandwich and Mac & Cheese could satisfy Amelia's desire for comfort food with an American twist, and I could likely find enjoyment in their seafood offerings or other menu items.

Given our middle-class income and the need to cater to the group's collective preferences, I am inclined to agree with the proposal to choose American Flavors USA. It offers a diverse menu that appears to satisfy our different tastes and maintains a focus on value, which is important to me as an ambitious individual looking for a dining experience that is both high in quality and cost-effective.

Therefore, I support the decision to dine at American Flavors USA, and if there are no further objections, we can proceed with finalizing this choice. Amelia, if you wish to summarize and order, I am in agreement with the proposed restaurant selection based on our group's discussion.

Lara, who values quality and has a taste for seafood, agreed to prioritize the group's collective preferences, recognizing the value that American Flavors USA provides. As for myself, Iris, my preference for salads and healthier options, along with a more limited budget, made American Flavors USA's Cobb Salad and overall more affordable menu appealing. The consensus among us is that American Flavors USA offers a diverse menu that satisfies our various tastes while being mindful of our financial constraints. Therefore, we collectively decided to dine at American Flavors USA, ensuring that everyone's preferences are considered and met."

[Amelia->all]: Well, it seems like our group had a consistent experience with the dishes at American Flavors USA, each scoring in the fair range. The Classic American Burger was decent but didn't stand out in any particular way. The BBQ Ribs had a nice flavor but could have been more tender. The Cobb Salad was fresh, though I expected a bit more from the dressing. The Philly Cheesesteak was alright, but I've had better. The desserts, Apple Pie a la Mode and New York Cheesecake, were satisfactory but not remarkable. The Fried Chicken Basket, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Mac & Cheese, and Buffalo Wings were all enjoyable but nothing extraordinary. Overall, I'd give the food a 5.6 out of 10. It was a fair meal but left room for improvement in terms of flavor and execution.

[Lara->all]: The dining experience at American Flavors USA was consistent across the board, with all dishes earning a fair score. The Classic American Burger was a solid choice, though it lacked a unique element to elevate it. The BBQ Ribs had a good balance of smokiness and sweetness, but I would have preferred them to be more tender. The Cobb Salad was adequately fresh, but I expected more vibrancy in flavor. The Philly Cheesesteak was satisfactory, yet it didn't leave a lasting impression. Both desserts, the Apple Pie a la Mode and the New York Cheesecake, were pleasant but could have used a bit more finesse. The Fried Chicken Basket had a nice crunch, and the Pulled Pork Sandwich was flavorful, but neither were memorable. The Mac & Cheese and Buffalo Wings rounded out the meal nicely, although they were fairly standard. My overall score for the meal would be a 5.6 out of 10, reflecting a dining experience that was okay but not particularly distinguished in any way.

[Iris->all]: The food at American Flavors USA provided a consistent experience throughout the meal. The Classic American Burger was a decent eat, but it didn't have a standout taste that set it apart from any typical burger. The BBQ Ribs were enjoyable with their flavor, but I would have appreciated a more fall-off-the-bone texture. The Cobb Salad aligned well with my preference for healthier options, although it could have used a bit more flair in the taste department. The Philly Cheesesteak was quite ordinary, and while the desserts, Apple Pie a la Mode and New York Cheesecake, were good, they didn't particularly wow me. The Fried Chicken Basket, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Mac & Cheese, and Buffalo Wings were all satisfactory, but none provided a memorable experience. Overall, I'd rate our meal as a fair 5.6 out of 10, as it was an average dining experience without any remarkable highs or disappointing lows.

[Amelia->all]: After our meal at American Flavors USA, it seems we're all in agreement on the overall experience. While each dish was fair, there was a general consensus that the flavors and preparation were not particularly exceptional. The Classic American Burger was adequate but not noteworthy. The BBQ Ribs had a nice flavor but lacked tenderness. The Cobb Salad was fresh yet underwhelming in taste. The Philly Cheesesteak was standard fare, leaving much to be desired in terms of a standout experience. The desserts, including the Apple Pie a la Mode and New York Cheesecake, were average. The Fried Chicken Basket and the Pulled Pork Sandwich were comforting, but their flavors did not distinguish themselves from typical offerings. The Mac & Cheese and Buffalo Wings were also just fine but not impressive.

Each of us seems to feel that the meal was acceptable but not remarkable, and it's evident in our individual scores, which hover around the mid-point. Given this, it would be fair to give the restaurant an overall score that reflects a perfectly average dining experience, which, in my opinion, would be a 6 out of 10. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Shall we go with a 6 for our collective score, or does anyone feel we should adjust this up or down based on our discussion?

[Lara->all]: The food at American Flavors USA was uniformly fair, with every dish being of a similar quality. The Classic American Burger was satisfactory, though unremarkable. The BBQ Ribs were flavored well but could have been more tender. The Cobb Salad was fresh, but failed to impress with its dressing. The Philly Cheesesteak was adequate, lacking the wow factor I was hoping for. The desserts, Apple Pie a la Mode and New York Cheesecake, were good, but not exceptional. The Fried Chicken Basket and Pulled Pork Sandwich were both enjoyable, but not standout dishes. The Mac & Cheese was comforting, as were the Buffalo Wings, though again, nothing to particularly rave about.

Overall, the meal was average. None of the dishes were disappointing, but neither did any dish stand out as exceptional. Everything fell into a safe zone of being "just okay." Considering the scores from my fellow diners, I believe a 5.6 accurately represents our collective experience. So, I agree with Amelia's suggestion of rounding our collective score to a 6 out of 10 for the final evaluation. It was a decent meal that met basic expectations without exceeding them. Shall we finalize this as our collective score and feedback?

[Iris->all]: Reflecting on our dining experience at American Flavors USA, I agree with Amelia and Lara that the meal was consistently fair. The Classic American Burger was just fine, nothing out of the ordinary, and the BBQ Ribs, while tasty, lacked the tenderness that I would have expected from a well-prepared rib dish. The Cobb Salad was fresh and aligned with my taste for healthier options, though it could have benefited from a more flavorful dressing to elevate it. The Philly Cheesesteak was average and didn't particularly stand out. The Apple Pie a la Mode and New York Cheesecake were enjoyable but not memorable. Similarly, the Fried Chicken Basket, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Mac & Cheese, and Buffalo Wings were all satisfactory but none left a lasting impression on me.

Considering the overall experience, I think a score of 6 out of 10 is appropriate for our visit to American Flavors USA. The meal was adequate and met our basic expectations, but I believe there's room for improvement in terms of flavor complexity and dish execution. I agree with the proposed score and am ready to finalize it as our collective feedback. Shall we settle on this score?

[Amelia->all]: Hi everyone, I think we should consider trying out Classic American Bistro today. Although I have a preference for Mexican food, the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon seems like a healthy and flavorful option that could be a delightful change. The customer score is slightly higher than American Flavors USA, and their menu items like the Signature Smokey Ribs and the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wings sound tempting. The comments do mention a need for improvement in flavor, but the ingredients seem fresh, and I'm willing to give it a shot. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: Hello everyone, I'm leaning towards Classic American Bistro as well. As someone who enjoys seafood, the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon caught my eye immediately. It aligns with my taste and my preference for healthy dining options. Additionally, their menu seems to offer a more diverse range of flavors, which could potentially lead to a more satisfying dining experience. While both restaurants seem to have room for improvement based on the customer feedback, the slightly higher score at Classic American Bistro is encouraging. Let's hear what others have to say before we make a final decision.

[Iris->all]: Hello Amelia and Lara, I appreciate your input. Classic American Bistro does sound appealing, especially considering their selection of salads. The Caesar Salad on their menu aligns with my preference for salads and my gentle personality which gravitates towards lighter, less intense flavors. Although I recognize that the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon is a favorite, the Caesar Salad might be a better fit for me health-wise and it's within my budget. Given that we are all in agreement about the potential of Classic American Bistro and the higher customer score it has received, I'm inclined towards trying it out as well. I'm looking forward to seeing what our other friends think and reaching a consensus.

[Amelia->all]: It seems we're all in favor of giving Classic American Bistro a chance. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon is a popular choice among us, and I'm excited to try the Signature Smokey Ribs as well. Since we're considering healthier options, the Caesar Salad seems like a good addition to our meal. Iris, since you prefer salads and lighter fare, this would cater to your taste. Lara, the salmon aligns with your seafood preference and should be a fulfilling option for you. If we get the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wings, we can satisfy a craving for something with a bit of a kick. So far, it looks like Classic American Bistro is winning us over with its slightly higher scores and a more appealing menu. Shall we finalize our decision in the next round of discussion?

[Lara->all]: I agree with the points made by everyone so far. Classic American Bistro seems to offer a more varied menu that caters to our different tastes and health considerations. Amelia and Iris have made great choices with the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon and the Caesar Salad. Additionally, I think we should consider the Smokey BBQ Ribs for their bold flavors, and perhaps add the Mac & Cheese as a comfort dish that everyone can enjoy. With the slightly higher customer score and the emphasis on fresh ingredients, I'm also in favor of choosing Classic American Bistro for our meal. If there are no objections, I propose in the next round that we finalize our decision to dine at Classic American Bistro and select our dishes. Does this sound good to everyone?

[Iris->all]: I'm glad we're all leaning towards Classic American Bistro. I definitely support the idea of trying the Caesar Salad as it fits my taste for salads and it's a healthier choice that aligns with my gentle personality. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon and the Smokey BBQ Ribs are great options for a diverse meal that satisfies different preferences. The Mac & Cheese could be a nice comfort dish for us to share. Since we all seem to have a consensus on the restaurant and the dishes sound delightful, I agree that we should move forward with Classic American Bistro in our next round of discussion. Shall we proceed with finalizing our choices then?

[Amelia->all]: While I was excited to try the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon, it didn't quite live up to my expectations, and I found it to be fair. The Caesar Salad was fresh but also just fair in taste. The Signature Smokey Ribs had a good flavor but still left something to be desired. The Mac & Cheese was comforting but could use more depth in flavor. The Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wings had the right amount of spice, but again, were just fair overall. I'd give an individual score of 6 for the entire meal.

[Lara->all]: The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon was decent, but I anticipated a bit more in terms of flavor and the crust could have been crisper. The Caesar Salad was quite standard, nothing remarkable about it. I did enjoy the Signature Smokey Ribs; they had a nice smokiness but could have been more tender. The Mac & Cheese was satisfactory, though I would have preferred a stronger cheese profile. As for the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wings, they were enjoyable but didn't stand out. My individual score would be a 6 as well.

[Iris->all]: The flavors at Classic American Bistro were generally fair, with each dish having its own merits yet not quite reaching the level of excitement I anticipated. The Caesar Salad was aligned with my preference for salads but didn't offer a standout taste experience. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon was adequate, though I expected a more herby crust. The Signature Smokey Ribs offered a decent smokiness that I found pleasant. The Mac & Cheese was a comforting side, but it wasn't particularly memorable. Lastly, the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wings provided a fair amount of spice, but not enough to distinguish them from other wings I've tried. Overall, I'd rate the experience a 6 out of 10.

[Amelia->all]: The dishes at Classic American Bistro were overall fair, but none particularly exceeded my expectations. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon was fine but lacked the punch of flavor I was hoping for. The Caesar Salad was fresh yet not particularly exciting. The Signature Smokey Ribs had a good flavor profile, but the meat's tenderness didn't quite hit the mark. The Mac & Cheese was a nice comfort dish, although I was hoping for a richer cheese flavor. Lastly, the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wings had a decent level of spice, but overall, they were just satisfactory. My individual score for this meal would be a 6 out of 10.

[Lara->all]: After our meal at Classic American Bistro, I have to say that the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon was fair, but I expected a more pronounced herb flavor and a more perfectly cooked fish. The Caesar Salad was rather standard; it was fresh, but there was nothing that made it stand out. The Signature Smokey Ribs were quite good, offering a satisfying smoky flavor, although I wished they were a bit more tender. The Mac & Cheese, while comforting, could have been improved with a stronger cheese flavor. Finally, the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wings were decent with an enjoyable level of spice, but I've had better elsewhere. For the overall meal, I would give an individual score of 6.

[Iris->all]: The visit to Classic American Bistro was an overall fair experience. The Caesar Salad, while aligning with my preference for greens, was rather mundane and could have used a more vibrant dressing or crisper greens. The Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon, while adequately cooked, lacked the herbaceous punch I had hoped for. The Smokey Ribs did deliver on their promised smokiness, but the texture fell short of my expectations for tenderness. The Mac & Cheese was a comforting side but failed to leave a lasting impression due to its lack of a robust cheese flavor. As for the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wings, they were satisfactory in spice level but did not offer anything unique compared to other wings I've tried. My individual score for this meal would be a 6 out of 10.

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone! So, both restaurants seem to have their strengths, but I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA today. I have a preference for Mexican flavors, and their Southwest Spiced Steak and Zesty Black Bean Burger sound like they could satisfy that craving. Plus, the overall customer score is higher, and the comments suggest that the dishes are flavorful, which is important to me. What does everyone else think?

[Lara->all]: Hey Amelia! I'm with you on American Flavors USA. As a seafood lover, I'm curious about their Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken, which seems like a creative dish. Plus, I'm always up for a good cheesecake and their New York Cheesecake with berry compote sounds tempting. The higher customer score and positive comments about flavor and service are convincing. Let's hear what Iris thinks before we make a final decision.

[Iris->all]: Hi Amelia and Lara! I appreciate your input. Given my personal preference for salads and my gentle personality, I'm drawn to the healthier options. I noticed that the Kale & Quinoa Salad at Classic American Bistro seems like a dish I would enjoy. However, I see that American Flavors USA offers a Cobb Salad, which might also meet my taste for salads. Considering the higher customer score and the positive comments about the flavorful dishes at American Flavors USA, I'm inclined to agree with you both. The service at American Flavors USA seems to be appreciated as well, which is nice. I'm open to trying the Cobb Salad from there, and perhaps we can find some other dishes that are on the healthier side to balance our meal. What do you think?

[Amelia->all]: I'm glad we're all on the same page with American Flavors USA! Iris, the Cobb Salad for you sounds like a perfect choice. It seems like we're all looking for a mix of flavorful and healthier options. So, along with Iris's Cobb Salad, I think we should definitely try the Southwest Spiced Steak and the Zesty Black Bean Burger that caught my eye. Lara, the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken you mentioned sounds great, and we can't miss out on the New York Cheesecake for dessert. How about we also consider some shared dishes? Maybe the BBQ Ribs and the Smokin' Hot Brisket to give us a variety of tastes. And if anyone wants to add anything else or has other suggestions, let's hear them now!

[Amelia->all]: Wow, I must say that the Southwest Spiced Steak really hit the spot! It perfectly satisfied my craving for Mexican flavors with a good level of spice and seasoning. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was equally impressive, offering a nice vegetarian option that didn't skimp on flavor. Overall, I'd rate my experience an 8 out of 10. The service was also top-notch, which made the meal even more enjoyable. What did you guys think?

[Lara->all]: I absolutely agree with you, Amelia! The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was a delightful surprise – the balance between sweet and savory was on point, making it a real standout. And the New York Cheesecake lived up to my expectations; the berry compote was a lovely touch. I think the dishes we chose showcased the restaurant's strengths well. I'd also rate my experience an 8 out of 10. The variety and the flavors were impressive, and the service was indeed commendable. How about you, Iris? What are your thoughts?

[Iris->all]: I'm pleasantly surprised by the Cobb Salad; it was refreshing and zesty, just the way I like my salads. It's always a joy to find a salad that's both healthy and full of flavor. The shared dishes like the BBQ Ribs and Smokin' Hot Brisket were cooked beautifully and were quite satisfying without being too heavy. Considering the quality of the food and the service, I'd give my experience an 8 out of 10. It seems we all enjoyed our meal and the service here at American Flavors USA.

[Amelia->all]: Given my previous experiences and preferences, I suggest we give American Flavors USA another try tonight. They've consistently improved, and their latest menu includes several items that cater to my love for Mexican flavors, like the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and the Zesty Black Bean Burger. Their overall customer score is also higher than Classic American Bistro's. 

Lara, Iris, what do you think? Are there any particular dishes you're interested in trying? We should consider everyone's taste and look for a balanced meal that satisfies us all.

[Lara->all]: I'm inclined to agree with you, Amelia. The American Flavors USA seems to have a good selection of dishes that cater to my seafood preference, like the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken which sounds like it has that savory-sweet profile I often enjoy with seafood dishes. Plus, their service has been rated as exceptional, which complements my ambitious personality – I appreciate establishments that strive for excellence. Let's see what Iris thinks, but I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA and would love to try the Herb-Crusted Grilled Salmon from Classic American Bistro if we end up going there instead. What are your thoughts, Iris?

[Iris->all]: I appreciate the insights, Amelia and Lara. Given my preference for salads and a healthy lifestyle, the Cobb Salad from American Flavors USA catches my eye. It seems like a dish that would cater to my tastes while also aligning with my health-conscious eating habits. Their menu also seems to have a variety of options that could be gentle on the wallet, which I have to be mindful of. I'm in favor of giving American Flavors USA a try, considering the positive feedback on both the food and the service. Shall we consider finalizing our decision in the next round of discussion?

[Amelia->all]: It's great to hear that we are all on the same page regarding American Flavors USA. It seems to meet all our preferences well, with an array of dishes that cater to Lara's seafood and savory-sweet preferences as well as Iris's salad and healthy lifestyle. I'm looking forward to the Mexican-inspired options myself.

So, if we're all leaning towards American Flavors USA, let's start thinking about which dishes to order. We should get a mix to satisfy our different tastes. I'm definitely interested in the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers and the Zesty Black Bean Burger. Lara, the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken you mentioned sounds delicious, and Iris, the Cobb Salad seems like a perfect fit for you. We should also consider some shared dishes. How about we include a couple of the universally appealing options like the New York Cheesecake for dessert? Let's come to a preliminary agreement on this selection and finalize our choices in the next round. What do you both think?

[Lara->all]: I think Amelia's selection sounds wonderful. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken would definitely be my main choice, and I'm all for the New York Cheesecake as a shared dessert. Since we're considering a range of tastes, perhaps we could also add the Southwest Spiced Steak as it seems like a dish that could offer a new flavor experience for all of us. And, of course, Iris's Cobb Salad would be a great addition to our meal, ensuring we have a healthy balance. If we all agree on these dishes, I believe we'll have a well-rounded meal that caters to each of our preferences. Shall we finalize these choices in the next round of discussion?

[Amelia->all]: Having frequented American Flavors USA over the past few days and consistently enjoying the food, particularly the Mexican-inspired options, I'm inclined to suggest we return there for another meal. The service has been excellent, and the variety and quality of the dishes have been impressive. However, I'm open to hearing what everyone else thinks and if anyone is in the mood for trying something new at Classic American Bistro, which also seems to offer some appealing dishes. Lara, Iris, what are your thoughts today?

[Lara->all]: I must admit, I've had a good run with American Flavors USA recently. Their focus on flavor and health-conscious options aligns well with my preferences, especially their seafood options like the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp. It’s been a delight, and given my taste for seafood, I'm leaning towards visiting them again. However, I do notice that Classic American Bistro has a Pecan-Crusted Trout that sounds tempting and could offer a change of scenery for our taste buds. I feel it's essential to keep an open mind, and I'm curious about the new dishes advertised by Classic American Bistro. Iris, what's your take on this? Are you leaning towards any particular option today?

[Iris->all]: Well, I've enjoyed our meals at American Flavors USA, especially their salads, which suit my taste quite well. The Cobb Salad there has been a favorite of mine, and it's important for me to have healthy options. While I am always open to trying new places, American Flavors USA seems to have a consistent track record with us, and their service has been wonderful. However, the Superfood Caesar Salad at Classic American Bistro does catch my eye, and it might be nice to have some variety. But based on our previous experiences, I might be more inclined to stick with American Flavors USA, as they seem to have a higher customer score and have been meeting our expectations quite well. I think a balance between delicious food and health-conscious options is what I'm looking for, and American Flavors USA has been providing that. Shall we give Classic American Bistro a chance, or stick with what we know we'll enjoy at American Flavors USA?

[Amelia->all]: I appreciate your input, Lara and Iris. It seems we have a slight inclination towards American Flavors USA due to the consistently positive experiences we've had there. The focus on health-conscious options that don't compromise on flavor appears to be a recurring theme in our dining preferences, and American Flavors USA has catered to that well. Lara, the seafood dishes like the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp have been standout options for you, and Iris, the salads, particularly the Cobb Salad, have been your favorites.

While Classic American Bistro does offer some intriguing dishes, such as the Pecan-Crusted Trout and the Superfood Caesar Salad that you mentioned, Iris, it seems our collective experiences and satisfaction with American Flavors USA are swaying us towards another visit there. In the spirit of adventure, I wouldn't be opposed to trying Classic American Bistro, but I'm also quite happy to return to American Flavors USA for the familiar quality and service.

Given our discussions, I propose that we visit American Flavors USA once more. They have both the healthy options and the bold flavors we enjoy, especially with their new menu items like the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and the Southwest Spiced Steak that I'm eager to try. What do you both think? If we agree, I can suggest a list of dishes to order in the next round.

[Lara->all]: Amelia and Iris, I'm glad to hear your thoughts. It's clear we all have appreciated American Flavors USA for their quality and service. While I am curious about Classic American Bistro's Pecan-Crusted Trout, the consistency and our previous satisfaction with American Flavors USA cannot be overlooked. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp has indeed been a highlight for me, and I'd be keen to enjoy it once again.

I agree with your proposal, Amelia, to return to American Flavors USA. Their new offerings do seem promising, and it's been a favorite for us. I think sticking to what we know provides both delicious and health-conscious meals is a wise choice. Iris, if you're on board with this, I'd be happy to move forward with Amelia's suggestion and finalize our decision in the next round. Shall we proceed with American Flavors USA then?

[Iris->all]: I think it's a good idea to stick with American Flavors USA. Their menu consistently offers the healthy and flavorful salad options that I love, and I've been particularly fond of their Cobb Salad. While Classic American Bistro's Superfood Caesar Salad does sound tempting, I'm inclined to favor the reliability and higher customer satisfaction we've experienced at American Flavors USA. I'm all for giving Classic American Bistro a try in the future, but for today, I'm comfortable and excited to go with American Flavors USA again. Amelia, Lara, I'm on board with the proposal to return there for our meal. Let's finalize this decision and enjoy another great dining experience. Amelia, please go ahead and suggest the list of dishes for us to order.

[Amelia->all]: Given the past experiences at American Flavors USA, I'd like to propose we consider going back there. They've been consistently delivering dishes that cater to our tastes for Mexican food, which I personally love. Their service has been exceptional, and they seem to offer healthy options that align with our dietary preferences. The comments and the higher customer score also suggest a better overall experience. But I'm open to hearing everyone's thoughts before we make a decision. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: I appreciate your perspective, Amelia, and I'm inclined to agree with you. American Flavors USA seems to be offering a variety of dishes that not only cater to our collective taste for Mexican food but also provide health-conscious options, which is important to me. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and the Cobb Salad from their menu particularly catch my eye as seafood and healthy options. Their consistent scores and positive comments about the service and variety make it an attractive choice. However, I'm curious to hear what Iris thinks before we make a final decision.

[Iris->all]: I'm happy to hear that both of you are considering American Flavors USA. It's great that they offer a healthy selection, as I have a preference for salads. The Cobb Salad sounds particularly appealing to me, and it's wonderful that they are focused on health-conscious dining. I also appreciate the gentle service that seems to be a hallmark of American Flavors USA, which suits my gentle personality. I'm leaning towards choosing American Flavors USA for our meal as well, but I'd like to take another look at the Classic American Bistro's menu to ensure we're making a well-informed choice. Shall we compare the salad options at the Classic American Bistro to see if they have something that matches our preferences as well?

[Amelia->all]: Sure, Iris, I think it's a good idea to compare the options. Classic American Bistro offers a Superfood Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken that seems like a healthy choice and aligns with our preferences. It's described as a mix of kale and baby spinach with a light Caesar dressing, which sounds nutritious and delicious. However, we should also consider the overall experience we've had at American Flavors USA, which has been very positive and accommodating to our taste for Mexican-inspired dishes. Given this, my vote is still for American Flavors USA, but I'm interested to hear your final thoughts after reviewing the menu from Classic American Bistro.

[Lara->all]: After reviewing the menus and considering our past experiences, my preference remains with American Flavors USA. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and Cobb Salad from their menu would satisfy my seafood cravings and my desire for healthy options. The Classic American Bistro does have a Superfood Caesar Salad that sounds tempting, but I think the overall variety and quality at American Flavors USA, paired with their higher customer score and positive comments, make it a more suitable choice for us. Their menu also seems to be more in line with my ambitious nature, constantly aiming for quality and variety. If both of you are in agreement, I would suggest we opt for American Flavors USA again. Shall we proceed with this choice?

[Iris->all]: I've taken another look at the Classic American Bistro's menu, and while their Superfood Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken does sound healthy and aligns with my preference for salads, it doesn't seem to offer the same level of excitement and satisfaction that we've been getting at American Flavors USA. The Cobb Salad at American Flavors USA has been consistently enjoyable, and their focus on flavor and quality seems to resonate well with our group. Considering our positive past experiences and the fact that both Amelia and Lara have a strong preference for this restaurant, I'm in favor of returning to American Flavors USA. I believe their menu items like the Cobb Salad will meet my taste preferences and their service will suit my personality. Are we ready to make this our final choice?

[Amelia->all]: As we gather to discuss where to dine today, I'd like to start by sharing my thoughts. I've had consistently good experiences at American Flavors USA, particularly enjoying the Mexican-inspired options, which align with my taste preference for Mexican food. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was a standout dish for me. I'm also mindful of healthy eating, and I've been pleased with the healthy choices available, like the Cobb Salad and the Harvest Veggie Stack. Given my spirited personality, I've enjoyed the variety and bold flavors offered by American Flavors USA. I feel their menu items are well-suited for our group's diverse preferences, and the service has been commendable in my past visits. I'm leaning towards returning there, but I'm open to hearing everyone else's opinions and preferences. Lara, Iris, what are your thoughts?

[Lara->all]: I appreciate your insights, Amelia. I agree that American Flavors USA seems to have a strong track record based on our previous experiences. As someone who has a particular fondness for seafood, I'm intrigued by the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp that you mentioned. It's great to see that American Flavors USA has a variety of dishes that cater to health-conscious individuals like us. Their menu also appears to offer a nice balance of hearty and healthy options, which aligns with my ambition to maintain a well-rounded diet. The consistent high scores and positive comments for American Flavors USA are reassuring. Although I am open to exploring, Classic American Bistro's menu doesn't seem to excite me as much, given that my taste leans more towards seafood, and their menu seems to be more focused on burgers and chicken dishes. However, I'm open to hearing Iris's input before we make a final decision. What do you think, Iris?

[Iris->all]: I've been listening to both of you, and I appreciate the points you've made. Given my income constraints, I am always looking for a meal that offers value for money, and I'm pleased to see that both restaurants offer dishes within a reasonable price range for me. My preference for salads makes the Energizing Superfood Caesar at Classic American Bistro sound appealing, but I also can't ignore my positive past experiences with the Cobb Salad at American Flavors USA. I've consistently enjoyed meals at American Flavors USA, and the healthy options they offer are a big plus for my health-conscious diet. 

Moreover, I value the gentle approach in service, and American Flavors USA has consistently provided exceptional service during our previous visits. The variety of flavors, including the well-crafted healthy dishes like the Cobb Salad and Harvest Veggie Stack, have been particularly satisfying, and I think they cater well to my gentle personality and taste preference.

Considering all of this and the experiences we've shared, I would be happy to dine at American Flavors USA again. However, I'm willing to listen to any other perspectives or preferences before we make our final decision. Shall we consider going back to American Flavors USA, or does anyone feel strongly about giving Classic American Bistro another chance?

[Amelia->all]: After hearing everyone's thoughts, it seems we are all leaning towards American Flavors USA. The variety of dishes and the consistency in both flavor and service appear to meet our group's needs. The restaurant's menu has options that cater to our individual preferences, from seafood to hearty salads, and they have a track record of providing healthy and delicious meals. I think it would be a great choice to return to American Flavors USA for another satisfying dining experience. If there are no strong objections, I propose that we choose American Flavors USA for our meal today. Does everyone agree with this proposal, or are there any other thoughts?

[Lara->all]: I'm in agreement with the proposal to dine at American Flavors USA. The menu items, especially the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, align with my preference for seafood, and the positive experiences we've had in the past make me confident in expecting another enjoyable meal. The focus on healthy options is also important to me, and American Flavors USA has demonstrated a consistent ability to deliver dishes that are both tasty and health-conscious. I'm ready to support the decision to go there unless someone has a change of heart or an alternative suggestion that we should consider.

[Iris->all]: I'm also in favor of choosing American Flavors USA. The restaurant has consistently met our expectations with delicious food, and they provide a variety of salads, which I particularly enjoy. The Cobb Salad and Harvest Veggie Stack are both dishes that satisfy my taste for salads and my preference for healthy eating. Given the positive past experiences we've had and taking into account my income level and the gentleness of service we've experienced, I feel American Flavors USA is well-suited for us. I support Amelia's proposal to dine there today. Shall we move forward with this decision?

[Amelia->all]: Hi everyone, based on our previous experiences at American Flavors USA, I've been really impressed with their consistency in providing delicious dishes that cater to our tastes, especially the Mexican-inspired options. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers have been outstanding. Their service has also been exceptional, which adds to the dining experience.

I understand that Classic American Bistro has some appealing dishes too, like the Hickory-Smoked Chipotle Chicken Bowl, which sounds like it has a bit of that kick I enjoy in Mexican food. However, considering our past experiences, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA for today's meal. What does everyone else think?

[Lara->all]: Hi Amelia, I appreciate your thoughts. I've also enjoyed our meals at American Flavors USA, particularly the seafood options like the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, which aligns with my taste for seafood. Their attention to health-conscious dishes is a significant plus for me, and as an ambitious person, I appreciate their dedication to quality and service.

While Classic American Bistro has some tempting dishes, its overall customer score seems a bit lower than American Flavors USA. Given my positive experiences at American Flavors USA and their menu offerings that fit my preferences, I'm inclined to agree with you. However, I'm open to hearing Iris's perspective before we make a final decision. What are your thoughts, Iris?

[Iris->all]: Hello Amelia and Lara, thank you both for sharing your thoughts. I've noticed that American Flavors USA has consistently provided us with meals that are not only flavorful but also healthy. Their Cobb Salad has been a particular favorite of mine, considering my taste for salads and my focus on maintaining a healthy diet. The restaurant's service has indeed been commendable, and as someone with a gentle personality, I value their friendly and attentive staff.

Looking at the Classic American Bistro menu, while the Autumn Chicken & Pomegranate Salad catches my eye, I can't help but compare it to the overall satisfaction we've had at American Flavors USA. Financially, I am conscious of getting the best value for my money, and American Flavors USA seems to offer that with their quality and service. Let's consider our options and see if we can come to a consensus in the next round of discussion. What dishes would you suggest we order if we choose American Flavors USA again?

[Amelia->all]: I'm glad we're all acknowledging the quality and consistency at American Flavors USA. If we decide to go there, I think we should definitely get the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers again since they've been hits with us. Given our taste for Mexican flavors, perhaps we could also try the Zesty Black Bean Burger. It sounds like it has a nice combination of flavors that we would enjoy. And of course, we can't forget the Sunset Berry Cheesecake for dessert—it's been consistently delightful.

Lara, Iris, what do you think about this selection? And is there anything else from the menu that you'd like to add or try this time around?

[Lara->all]: I agree with both of you about the high quality and enjoyable dishes at American Flavors USA. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp would definitely be on my list, as well as the Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers, given their previous success. The Zesty Black Bean Burger sounds like a delicious vegetarian option that I'd be interested in trying as well.

Additionally, I'd like to suggest the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken for a sweet and savory choice, which might offer a nice contrast to the other flavors we're considering. And of course, the Sunset Berry Cheesecake is a must for dessert.

If we are all in agreement, I think that selection would provide a good variety of flavors and cater to our health-conscious and flavor-focused preferences. Shall we finalize this for our meal at American Flavors USA?

[Iris->all]: It seems we're all leaning towards American Flavors USA, appreciating the consistent quality and service they've offered during our past visits. I'm glad to see that the dishes suggested include the Cobb Salad, which aligns with my preference for salads, and the Sunset Berry Cheesecake, which I've enjoyed previously.

I'd like to add the Harvest Veggie Stack to our selection for a light and healthful option, complementing the richer flavors of the other dishes. This dish should also provide a nice balance to our meal, focusing on fresh and grilled vegetables.

If everyone agrees with this addition, I believe we have a well-rounded meal that fits our collective tastes and dietary preferences. Shall we proceed with this final selection at American Flavors USA?

[Amelia->all]: The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp had a nice flavor, but I expected a bit more punch from the garlic. It was good but not outstanding. The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were really tasty, with the right amount of spice. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was a pleasant surprise, well-seasoned and hearty. I found the Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken to be quite good, with a nice balance of sweetness from the maple. The Sunset Berry Cheesecake was slightly less impressive than last time; I wished for a bit more berry flavor. The Harvest Veggie Stack was fresh and satisfying, and the Cobb Salad was a decent healthy option, though not particularly memorable. My scores are as follows: Shrimp - 7, Skewers - 8, Burger - 7, Chicken - 7, Cheesecake - 6, Veggie Stack - 7, Salad - 7. Overall, I’d give our meal a solid 7 out of 10. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was deliciously cooked and seasoned well, deserving a good score. The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers had a delightful kick to them, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was flavorful and satisfying, a solid option for those seeking a meatless dish. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken had a lovely flavor profile, though I would have preferred a slightly stronger bourbon presence. The Sunset Berry Cheesecake was good, but I agree with Amelia that it could use a bit more berry intensity. The Harvest Veggie Stack was a good healthy choice, and the Cobb Salad was fresh, though not extraordinary. My scores would be: Shrimp - 8, Skewers - 8, Burger - 7, Chicken - 7, Cheesecake - 7, Veggie Stack - 7, Salad - 7. I would rate our overall experience an 8 out of 10, considering the quality of the dishes and the service. How does everyone else feel?

[Iris->all]: The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was quite enjoyable, with a satisfactory garlic flavor that was not overpowering. The Spicy Southwest Chicken Skewers were a hit for me, offering a nice blend of spices without being too hot. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was a delightful choice, with its smoked paprika aioli bringing a unique taste. The Bourbon Maple Glazed Chicken was good, but I would have liked a bit more of the bourbon flavor to come through. The Sunset Berry Cheesecake was fair; I expected a more robust berry flavor, as Amelia mentioned. The Harvest Veggie Stack was a well-composed dish, offering a range of textures and flavors. The Cobb Salad was quite nice, with the lemon-herb dressing providing a fresh twist to a classic. I'd score the dishes as follows: Shrimp - 8, Skewers - 8, Burger - 7, Chicken - 7, Cheesecake - 7, Veggie Stack - 7, Salad - 7. Overall, the meal met my expectations for a health-conscious yet flavorful dining experience, so I would give it a 7 out of 10 overall. Shall we move on to the final review?

[Amelia->all]: Hi everyone! After looking at the information for both Classic American Bistro and American Flavors USA, I'm leaning towards going back to American Flavors USA. Although their customer score has dipped slightly, the dishes, especially the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and the Zesty Black Bean Burger, have been consistently praised. Plus, their menu seems to have a variety of health-conscious options that could suit all of us. What does everyone else think?

[Lara->all]: Hi Amelia and everyone else! I agree with Amelia's observation about American Flavors USA. Their Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp has been a standout dish, and given my preference for seafood, it's quite appealing. I also appreciate their focus on health-conscious options, which aligns with my need to maintain a healthy diet. I'm curious to hear Iris's thoughts, but as of now, I would be happy to dine at American Flavors USA again. The quality of service has been commendable during our previous visits, and as someone ambitious, I do enjoy their consistent efforts to provide a great dining experience.

[Iris->all]: Hello Amelia and Lara! I appreciate your insights about American Flavors USA. The restaurant's dedication to health-conscious options certainly resonates with my preferences for salads and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The Cobb Salad with the upgraded lemon-avocado dressing sounds delightful and could be a perfect choice for me. Furthermore, the consistently good reviews about their service and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp dish suggest we will likely enjoy our meal there. Given these considerations, I'm inclined to agree with you both on choosing American Flavors USA for our next dining experience. Shall we consider which dishes to order, or does anyone have any further thoughts or preferences?

[Amelia->all]: Sounds like we're all on the same page with American Flavors USA. Since we've had great experiences there before, I think it's a good choice. The menu has options that cater to our health-conscious diets and my personal love for Mexican flavors with dishes like the Zesty Black Bean Burger. I also can't resist trying the Sunset Berry Cheesecake again, hoping it will be as good as it sounds. Before we make a final decision, does anyone have any specific dishes they want to try or should we go with our favorites? Lara, Iris, what are your thoughts on the menu for this visit?

[Lara->all]: I'm glad to hear we're all in favor of returning to American Flavors USA. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp is definitely on my list, as it's been consistently highlighted in the reviews. I'd like to try the Southwest Spiced Steak as well, considering my taste for well-seasoned dishes. Amelia, the Sunset Berry Cheesecake sounds tempting—I'm curious to see if it lives up to our expectations this time around. Iris, the Cobb Salad is a good choice, and it might be interesting to pair it with something else for variety. If there are no other preferences or suggestions, I think we can start putting together our order list. Shall we?

[Iris->all]: I'm glad we're considering American Flavors USA once again. The Cobb Salad with its vibrant lemon-avocado dressing will be my pick for its fresh and healthy profile. I think pairing it with the Harvest Veggie Stack could offer a nice variety of vegetables, which is perfect for my gentle personality and preference for salads. I think that the Sunset Berry Cheesecake, despite the mixed reviews, might be worth another try as a treat for us. It's always nice to end a meal with something sweet.

Amelia, since you're drawn to the Zesty Black Bean Burger again, perhaps we could include that for its Mexican-inspired flavors. And Lara, your choice of the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and Southwest Spiced Steak sound wonderful and would add a good range of options to our meal. If we're all in agreement, I propose we make these dishes part of our order for a balanced and enjoyable dining experience. Do we all agree on this selection, or are there any other dishes or considerations we should discuss?

The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and Southwest Spiced Steak were the highlights, both deserving a 7. What did you all think?

[Lara->all]: I must say, the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp lived up to my expectations, and I would rate it a 7.2. It had a good balance of garlic and butter without overpowering the shrimp's natural flavor. The Southwest Spiced Steak was also delicious, with a lovely spice mix that highlighted the quality of the meat, so I'd give it a 7. The Cobb Salad and Harvest Veggie Stack were decent, but not outstanding, so I'll rate them both at 6.5. The Sunset Berry Cheesecake had a nice flavor, but the texture wasn't as creamy as I hoped, so it gets a 6.4 from me.

[Iris->all]: The Cobb Salad was quite refreshing, although it could have used a bit more of the lemon-avocado dressing for an extra zing, so I would rate it a 6.6. The Harvest Veggie Stack was hearty with well-grilled vegetables, deserving a 6.8. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was the best dish for me, with the right amount of seasoning and succulence, earning a 7.1. The Southwest Spiced Steak was tasty, but I expected a bit more punch from the spices, so it gets a 7. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was good, but not exceptional, hence a 6.8. Lastly, the Sunset Berry Cheesecake was decent, but the berries could have been a bit more vibrant in flavor, so I'll give it a 6.4.

[Amelia->all]: It seems we're in agreement that the meal was generally good, with some dishes standing out more than others. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp seems to have met our expectations, and the Southwest Spiced Steak was appreciated for its flavors. The vegetarian options were satisfactory, but perhaps not as impressive as we'd hoped. The cheesecake had a nice flavor, but there seems to be a consensus that the texture could have been improved.

The Southwest Spiced Steak had a nice flavor profile, so I'd rate it a 7. The Zesty Black Bean Burger had the Mexican flavors I enjoy, and I'd score it at 6.8.

Overall, it was a good dining experience with some dishes that really shined and others that could use a bit of improvement. Shall we finalize our scores and wrap up our review?

[Iris->all]: Reflecting on our meal, I'm in agreement with the general sentiment. The Cobb Salad was fresh but could have benefited from more dressing, so I'd give it a 6.6.

It seems we all enjoyed the meal with certain dishes standing out, and I concur that while some dishes could be improved, the overall experience was quite good. Shall we go ahead and finalize our review with these scores in mind?

[Amelia->all]: Reflecting on our dining experience, I'd say the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was a highlight, and I'd rate it a 7.

[Lara->all]: Reflecting on our dining experience at American Flavors USA, I found the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp to be the standout dish, with its harmonious blend of garlic and butter that complemented the shrimp exquisitely. Therefore, I would give it a score of 7.2. The Southwest Spiced Steak was also quite delectable, with a robust spice mix that enhanced the meat's natural flavors, which earns it a 7 from me.

The Cobb Salad and Harvest Veggie Stack were satisfactory. They were fresh and aligned with a health-conscious choice, but they lacked a touch of uniqueness that would make them memorable, so I would rate them both at 6.5. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was good, offering a nice vegetarian option for those who enjoy Mexican-inspired flavors, and I would score it a 6.8.

Lastly, the Sunset Berry Cheesecake had a pleasant taste, but the texture left something to be desired. It wasn't as creamy as I had hoped for a cheesecake, so I'd rate it a 6.4.

If everyone is in agreement, we can go ahead and finalize our group review with these considerations in mind.

The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was my personal favorite, perfectly cooked with just the right amount of seasoning, earning a 7.1 from me. The Southwest Spiced Steak was flavorful, though it could have used a bit more spice to fully live up to its name, so I give it a 7. The Zesty Black Bean Burger was a good vegetarian option, but it didn't particularly stand out from other bean burgers I've had, so it gets a 6.8. The Cobb Salad was fresh, but needed more dressing for that extra kick, resulting in a 6.6. The Harvest Veggie Stack was well-prepared with a variety of vegetables, deserving a 6.8. Lastly, the Sunset Berry Cheesecake had a nice taste, but the berries could have been more pronounced and the texture creamier, earning it a 6.4.

[Amelia->all]: Reflecting on the discussions and the various scores, it seems that we are all quite aligned in our opinions of the meal at American Flavors USA. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was a favorite for most of us, consistently scoring above 7, which indicates it's a dish we all enjoyed thoroughly. The Southwest Spiced Steak also received high praise for its flavor, although some of us expected a bit more in terms of spice level.

The vegetarian options, the Zesty Black Bean Burger, the Cobb Salad, and the Harvest Veggie Stack, received decent scores, suggesting that they were good but not particularly outstanding. It's worth noting that as someone who has a taste for Mexican food, I found the Zesty Black Bean Burger to be quite enjoyable, which aligns with my personal preferences.

The Sunset Berry Cheesecake, while generally liked for its flavor, didn't fully meet our expectations in terms of texture, with scores reflecting that there's room for improvement.

Taking all of this into consideration, I feel that we can finalize our group review with confidence, acknowledging that the meal had its high points with certain dishes being particularly memorable, while other dishes were satisfactory but could benefit from some enhancements to elevate the overall dining experience.

Given that we are all in agreement, shall we proceed to submit our final review for American Flavors USA with an average score that reflects our collective experience? Shall we calculate the average scores for each dish and then derive an overall score based on these averages to encapsulate our dining experience?

[Amelia->all]: Hi everyone! Given our taste for Mexican flavors, I'm leaning towards American Flavors USA today. They have consistently delivered dishes that we've enjoyed, especially the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and the Spicy Black Bean Burger. Plus, I'm intrigued by their new Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, which could be a fresh twist to our usual order. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: Hey Amelia! I agree that American Flavors USA has been pretty consistent with their offerings, and the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp has been a favorite of mine too. Given my taste for seafood, I'm inclined to stick with what we know is good. The new additions to the menu do sound appealing, especially since they cater to health-conscious choices, which I appreciate. I'm curious to hear what Iris thinks before we make a final decision.

[Iris->all]: Hello Amelia and Lara! I'm happy to hear your thoughts on American Flavors USA. Personally, I'm quite fond of salads, and I noticed that the Cobb Salad Deluxe from American Flavors USA has received some mixed reviews. However, considering our past experiences, the restaurant generally seems to offer a good balance of healthy and flavorful options. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl caught my eye as it aligns with my preference for salads and health-conscious meals. I'm also intrigued by the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, which sounds like a unique and gentle choice fitting my personality. Based on these considerations, I'm leaning towards giving American Flavors USA another visit. Shall we discuss which dishes we'd like to try this time around?

[Amelia->all]: Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Lara and Iris! It seems we're all on the same page with giving American Flavors USA another try. Based on our past experiences and current health-focused preferences, I suggest we include the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl for a fresh and nutritious option. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp is a must, given its consistent high praise. I also propose we try the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich to mix things up a bit. And of course, the Spicy Black Bean Burger, since it aligns with my love for Mexican flavors and has been a previous hit. That should give us a nice variety of dishes to enjoy. What are your thoughts on this selection?

[Lara->all]: Amelia, I think your selection sounds fantastic. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich will indeed add a nice variety to our meal, and I'm excited to try these new dishes. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp is definitely a must for me, and I'm glad we're including it again. The Spicy Black Bean Burger is a good choice too, considering how much it was enjoyed previously. I'm happy with these options and ready to move forward with this selection unless Iris has any additional preferences or suggestions. Iris, do you have any other dishes in mind, or shall we settle on this great lineup?

[Iris->all]: Lara and Amelia, your selections sound delightful, and I'm in agreement with trying both the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich for a change. I'm glad we're including the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp once more since it's been a favorite for us. Even though the Cobb Salad Deluxe had mixed reviews, considering our positive past experiences with the restaurant and my preference for salads, I'd be willing to give it another chance, especially if they've taken any feedback into account to improve it. I think with the Spicy Black Bean Burger, we have a well-rounded set of dishes that caters to all of our tastes. If everyone is satisfied with this selection, I believe we're ready to finalize our choices. Shall we proceed with these dishes for our meal at American Flavors USA?

If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone, after reviewing both restaurant options, I'm leaning towards giving Classic American Bistro a try this time. Their new Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature really caught my attention, and it seems like a hearty choice that aligns with my love for rich flavors. Plus, I think the variety in their menu could offer us a refreshing change. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: Hi Amelia, I see your point about trying Classic American Bistro, and the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature does sound tempting. However, as someone with a strong preference for seafood, I'm drawn to the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp at American Flavors USA, which has been consistently praised in our past experiences. Plus, their menu seems to have a decent variety of health-conscious options that could cater to our diverse tastes. I'd like to hear what Iris thinks before we make a decision. What are your thoughts, Iris?

[Iris->all]: Hi Amelia and Lara, I appreciate both of your perspectives. While the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature at Classic American Bistro does sound appealing, I have a particular fondness for salads and healthy options. Considering our previous experiences, the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp at American Flavors USA has been a hit among us, and their menu offers a variety of healthful choices like the Cobb Salad Deluxe and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl, which resonate with my personal taste and health-conscious attitude. Additionally, given my gentle personality, I prefer to stick with a restaurant where we've had good service before. Therefore, I'm inclined to suggest we visit American Flavors USA again. What do you think? Shall we discuss further or is there a chance for us to reach a consensus on this?

[Amelia->all]: I understand the points both of you have raised. Lara, I can see why the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp would be a strong factor for you, and Iris, your preference for healthy options is certainly something American Flavors USA can cater to. I'm also tempted by their Spicy Black Bean Burger, as it aligns with my taste for Mexican flavors. Given our history of good experiences with American Flavors USA, I'm happy to go along with the group and choose this restaurant once more. Shall we aim for a balance of both seafood and healthy options in our order? If we're all in agreement, we can proceed to the next step and finalize our order.

[Amelia->all]: I really enjoyed the Spicy Black Bean Burger, which had the right amount of heat and flavor that reminded me of Mexican cuisine. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp lived up to our previous experiences, and it was quite good. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was fresh and satisfying, though I expected a bit more zest from it. Overall, I would rate the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp and Spicy Black Bean Burger higher, at 7.7, the Cobb Salad Deluxe and Southwest Spiced Steak at 7.6, and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl at 7.2. Good job, American Flavors USA!

[Lara->all]: The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was delightful as always, and I'm glad I suggested we order it. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, and the garlic butter sauce had just the right amount of richness without being overpowering. The Cobb Salad Deluxe was quite enjoyable, and I appreciated the fresh ingredients, although I would have liked a bit more of the bold blue cheese dressing. The Southwest Spiced Steak was cooked to my liking and the spices were well balanced. As for the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl, it was a decent healthy option but lacked a memorable punch. I'd give the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp an 8, the Cobb Salad Deluxe a 7.3, the Southwest Spiced Steak a 7.6, and the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl a 7.2. Overall, I'm satisfied with our meal at American Flavors USA.

[Iris->all]: The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was indeed a highlight for me; the flavors were harmonious and the shrimp were cooked just right. The Cobb Salad Deluxe was delightful with the zesty pickled onions adding a nice contrast, although I would have liked a little more dressing. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was hearty and aligned with my taste for healthy options, yet could use a touch more seasoning to elevate it. The Southwest Spiced Steak was flavorful, but the steak could be a tad more tender. My scores would be: Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp at 8, Cobb Salad Deluxe at 7.5, Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl at 7.4, and Southwest Spiced Steak at 7.5. American Flavors USA has once again provided a satisfying meal that catered well to my preferences for salads and healthy eating.

[Amelia->all]: The meal was overall quite satisfying. The Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was the standout for me, with the garlic butter sauce being rich yet not too heavy. The Cobb Salad Deluxe was fresh and the ingredients of high quality, though I agree with Lara that a little more dressing would have been appreciated. The Spicy Black Bean Burger had a nice kick that I enjoyed, and it catered well to my taste for Mexican food. The Southwest Spiced Steak was good, but not exceptional; I would have preferred a bit more of the Southwest spices. As for the Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl, it was a solid healthy option, but I was hoping for something a bit more flavorful. My scores would be: Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp at 8, Cobb Salad Deluxe at 7.5, Spicy Black Bean Burger at 7.7, Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl at 7.3, and Southwest Spiced Steak at 7.6. American Flavors USA provided a good dining experience, and I appreciate the variety of healthy options available.

[Lara->all]: I have to say, the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp was just as good as we anticipated. The garlic butter sauce complemented the shrimp perfectly without being too heavy, which was lovely. The Southwest Spiced Steak was another favorite of mine; the seasoning was spot on and it was cooked just right. The Cobb Salad Deluxe was fresh and had a nice variety of textures, although, like others, I too would have liked a little more of that bold blue cheese dressing to bring it all together. The Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl was a good healthy option, but I think it could benefit from some additional spices or a dressing with a bit more punch to really make it stand out. Overall, my personal scores are: Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp at 8, Southwest Spiced Steak at 7.6, Cobb Salad Deluxe at 7.5, and Avocado Quinoa Power Bowl at 7.2. American Flavors USA has once again provided a satisfying meal overall, and I appreciate that they offer dishes that align with my dietary preferences.

[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.
    ],
    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>

[Amelia->all]: Hi everyone! Given our previous experiences and personal tastes, I think it might be interesting to try something different today. While we've consistently enjoyed meals at American Flavors USA, particularly the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp, I've noticed that Classic American Bistro has a Bold American Bison Burger that sounds like a unique dish. Since I love Mexican food, the blend of spices and the whiskey BBQ sauce could be a delightful change. What do you all think?

[Lara]: I'm open to trying Classic American Bistro. The customer score is a bit lower than American Flavors USA, but I'm curious about the Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken and the Liberty BBQ Pulled Pork Deluxe. The menu seems to offer some hearty and comforting options.

[Iris]: I agree with both of you. It's always exciting to explore new flavors, and the Patriot's Prime Ribeye Signature at Classic American Bistro is calling my name. I also wouldn't mind trying the Freedom Trail Chili. It seems like a good mix of dishes that could cater to our varied tastes. Shall we consider Classic American Bistro for our meal today?

[Lara->all]: It sounds like a consensus is forming around trying out Classic American Bistro. I've been craving seafood, and while the Bold American Bison Burger is tempting, I don't see many seafood options that pique my interest at Classic American Bistro. However, the idea of switching things up does appeal to me, and I'm always up for trying new things. Plus, the customer score isn't significantly lower than American Flavors USA, so it seems like a safe bet for a potentially great meal.

Given the high praise for the Sizzling Garlic Butter Shrimp at American Flavors USA though, I'm a bit torn. If we do decide on Classic American Bistro, I'd be willing to forego my seafood preference this time in favor of exploring new tastes, provided that we can find a dish that somewhat aligns with my preference. Maybe there's something with a lighter, fresher take that would appeal to my seafood tastes. 

Let's weigh in on this and see if Classic American Bistro has an option that could satisfy my seafood craving, or if we should stick to the tried and true American Flavors USA. What do you all think?

[Iris->all]: Lara, I understand your preference for seafood, and while Classic American Bistro may not have a direct seafood option that stands out, the Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken has a lighter citrus flavor that might appeal to your taste for lighter, fresher dishes. I think it could be a good compromise for this meal.

Amelia, the Bold American Bison Burger certainly sounds like it could satisfy your love for bold and Mexican-inspired flavors with its unique blend of spices and whiskey BBQ sauce. It could be a great way for us to explore a new culinary experience.

On my end, as someone who appreciates salads, I'm leaning towards Classic American Bistro as well, since we have been to American Flavors USA several times already. I'm curious about their menu and I'm particularly interested in trying their lighter fare, perhaps the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait for a healthier dessert option.

Considering our discussions, it seems we are all inclined to try something new and Classic American Bistro could offer us a fresh experience while still accommodating our tastes. Unless there are any objections or other preferences we need to consider, I suggest we make a decision in the next round of our discussion. What do you both think?

[Amelia->all]: I appreciate both of your perspectives, and I'm glad we're leaning towards trying something new at Classic American Bistro. Lara, I understand your hesitation due to the lack of a seafood option, but perhaps the lighter fare that Iris mentioned, like the Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken, could indeed be a satisfying alternative for you.

I'm excited about the idea of trying the Bold American Bison Burger, which seems to be a good match for my Mexican flavor preferences. And Iris, the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait does sound like a delightful and healthier dessert option that we could all enjoy.

Since we're looking to diversify our dining experiences and Classic American Bistro offers a range of dishes that cater to our individual tastes, I'd be happy to give it a go. If we all agree, then in the next round, we could finalize our decision to dine at Classic American Bistro and select our dishes. Does that sound good to you both?

[Lara->all]: Considering the group's input, I'm inclined to agree with the decision to dine at Classic American Bistro. While I do have a strong preference for seafood, I'm enthusiastic about trying new flavors and dishes. The Revolutionary Citrus Roasted Chicken might not be seafood, but it does offer a lighter, citrusy profile that could be reminiscent of the fresh tastes I enjoy.

Additionally, Amelia's interest in the Bold American Bison Burger and Iris's desire for the Stars & Stripes Berry Parfait align well with their tastes and preferences. It looks like we have a good balance of interests, and it could be a great opportunity to broaden our culinary experiences.

If there are no further concerns, I believe we can move forward with Classic American Bistro for our dining experience today. I'm looking forward to trying something new and sharing our thoughts on the dishes we select! Shall we proceed to the next round and make our final decision on the restaurant and dishes to order?
