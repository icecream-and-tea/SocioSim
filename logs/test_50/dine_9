    "score": 4,
    "comment": "While the menu variety and prices at Le Petit Gourmet were appealing, the taste of the dishes didn't meet my expectations. The Beef Bourguignon lacked the depth of flavor I was hoping for, and the Cheese Plate, while decent, didn't wow me. I believe the restaurant could benefit from further enhancing the flavors of their dishes and perhaps offering a few more options for meat lovers like myself."
