    "comment": "Although Le Petit Gourmet offers a wide variety of dishes, the overall taste of the food did not meet my expectations. The Coq au Vin and Ratatouille were slightly underseasoned, and the Tarte Tatin could have been more caramelized. However, the French Onion Soup and Beef Bourguignon were quite good, with rich flavors and hearty ingredients. The Quiche Lorraine was decent, but nothing outstanding. The Crème Brûlée was a good end to the meal, with its creamy texture and hard caramel top. While the restaurant offers good value for the price, I believe there is room for improvement in terms of food taste and seasoning. I will consider trying La Petite Maison next time for comparison."

The Coq au Vin and Beef Bourguignon were particularly lackluster, missing the rich wine-infused taste that is characteristic of these dishes. The Ratatouille, however, was a highlight with its well-cooked vegetables and balanced seasoning. The service was also quite good, but the food did not live up to my expectations. I believe the restaurant could improve by focusing on the quality of their dishes rather than the quantity."
