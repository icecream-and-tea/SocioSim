    "comment": "The ambiance of Le Petit Gourmet was warm and inviting. The Coq au Vin and Beef Bourguignon were flavorful, but I felt they could use a bit more seasoning. The Ratatouille was a bit undercooked, and the French Onion Soup was a tad too salty for my liking. However, the Salade Niçoise was truly delightful with its fresh ingredients and balanced flavors. Service was friendly, but the waiting time for the dishes was slightly longer than expected. Despite these minor issues, I would still consider coming back to try other dishes on the menu."

The Coq au Vin and Ratatouille, although described appealingly, were somewhat lacking in depth of flavor. The French Onion Soup and Beef Bourguignon were satisfactory but not exceptional. The Cheese Plate was decent, with a good variety of cheeses, but overall, I found the meal to be average. I appreciate the effort to provide a range of dishes, but I believe there is room for improvement in terms of taste and flavor. I hope to see some positive changes in the future."
