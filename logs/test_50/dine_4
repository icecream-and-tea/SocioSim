    "comment": "The food at Le Petit Gourmet was average, nothing particularly stood out. The Coq au Vin lacked depth of flavor and the Ratatouille was slightly overcooked. The Tarte Tatin, however, was quite good, with a nice balance of sweet and tart. The service was decent but could be improved. Compared to the other restaurant in town, the prices here are more affordable, which is a plus. However, I believe the taste and quality of the dishes need improvement."

If I were to compare with another restaurant, I would say the taste could be on par, but the presentation and flavor complexity might need some improvements."

Despite its affordability, I am hesitant to return based on this experience."
