    "comment": "While I appreciated the variety of the menu at Le Petit Gourmet, the overall taste of the dishes I ordered was quite average. The Salade Niçoise could have used more dressing, and the Croque Monsieur, while flavorful, was a bit too greasy for my liking. The Quiche Lorraine was the standout, with a nice balance of flavors. In terms of service, the staff was friendly and attentive. I think I might have expected a bit too much based on the restaurant's advertisement. I would suggest they focus more on the quality and execution of their dishes. Compared to other restaurants I've been to, Le Petit Gourmet has room for improvement."

In comparison to some other restaurants I have visited, the food at Le Petit Gourmet didn't quite hit the mark. I believe there's room for improvement in terms of flavors and balance in their dishes."
