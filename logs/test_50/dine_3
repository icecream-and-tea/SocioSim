    "comment": "The experience at Le Petit Gourmet was decent. The variety of dishes offered a chance to taste different aspects of French cuisine. The Coq au Vin and Ratatouille, although flavorful, were slightly salty for my liking, given my dietary restriction. The Tarte Tatin was beautifully caramelized and served as a sweet ending to the meal. The French Onion Soup and Croque Monsieur were decent, but nothing outstanding. Overall, I appreciate the affordability and variety, but the dishes could be better tailored to accommodate dietary restrictions. If I were to compare this with other dining experiences, I'd say it's average."

In terms of service, the staff were friendly but the waiting time was longer than expected. I hope they can improve on these aspects in the future."
