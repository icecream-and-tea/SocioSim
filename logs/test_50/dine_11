    "restaurant": "Le Petit Gourmet",
    "score": 5,
    "comment": "The dishes at Le Petit Gourmet were decent, but not as exceptional as I had hoped. The Coq au Vin and Ratatouille were a bit underwhelming in terms of flavor, and the Tarte Tatin, while good, was not the best I've had. The Cheese Plate was quite nice, with a good variety of cheeses. Overall, the experience was average. I believe that the restaurant could benefit from enhancing the flavors in their dishes and perhaps adding some unique twists to their traditional offerings."
