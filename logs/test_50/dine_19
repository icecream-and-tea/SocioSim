    "score": 4,
    "comment": "I had high expectations for Le Petit Gourmet, but unfortunately, my experience was not as great as I had hoped. The dishes were pretty average in terms of taste. The Coq au Vin and Ratatouille were decent but not memorable, and the Tarte Tatin lacked the rich caramel flavor I was expecting. The Cheese Plate was the highlight of the meal with a nice selection of cheeses and fresh fruits. I would suggest the restaurant to work on enhancing the flavors of their dishes. Despite the affordable prices, the food needs to be more impressive for a return visit."
