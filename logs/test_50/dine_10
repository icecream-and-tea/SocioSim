[Katie->Katie]: {
    "restaurant": "Le Petit Gourmet",
    "score": 4,
    "comment": "While I appreciated the affordable prices and the variety of vegan-friendly options at Le Petit Gourmet, I found the taste of the dishes to be average. The Ratatouille could have used more seasoning and the Tarte Tatin was a bit too sweet for my liking. The Salade Niçoise was the highlight of the meal with its fresh ingredients. However, overall, the flavors did not meet my expectations. I would suggest the chefs to pay more attention to the balance of flavors in their dishes."
