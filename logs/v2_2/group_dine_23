[Amelia->all]: Given my preference for Mexican food, neither "American Flavors" nor "USA Star Diner" exactly matches my taste since both are American-style restaurants. However, considering the other criteria such as lower price, delicious food, and superior service, I'd like to propose that we consider the "USA Star Diner" for the following reasons:

1. The prices at "USA Star Diner" are generally lower than at "American Flavors", which fits well with my middle-class income.
2. The "USA Star Diner" offers a Combo Meal Deal which could provide additional value for money.
3. While the food at both restaurants is American, the "USA Star Diner" has a few items like Chili Cheese Fries and Mac & Cheese Deluxe that I find appealing and imagine could be delicious, fitting the criteria for delicious food.
4. Neither restaurant has customer scores or comments available, so we don't have direct feedback on service. However, the advertisement for "USA Star Diner" suggests a focus on customer experience with their combo meals and specials.

I'd like to hear other members' views on this and see if we can reach a preliminary agreement in this round.

[Lara->all]: As a seafood enthusiast, neither "American Flavors" nor "USA Star Diner" directly caters to my primary taste. However, considering the overall value, including affordability, food quality, and service, I lean towards "USA Star Diner" for a few reasons:

1. The prices at "USA Star Diner" are more budget-friendly, which aligns with my income as a middle-class individual.
2. While "USA Star Diner" doesn't specialize in seafood, they offer a diverse menu with potentially delicious options like the Smokey BBQ Ribs and Pulled Pork Sandwich.
3. The Combo Meal Deals at "USA Star Diner" suggest a customer-centric approach, which might indicate superior service.

I agree with Amelia's proposal to consider "USA Star Diner” for our meal. However, I would like to discuss with the group if there's a chance any of the dishes can be customized to include a seafood option or if there's a dish that might be more satisfying for a seafood lover like myself. If not, I'm still open to trying something new, perhaps one of the specials mentioned in the advertisement. Let's see what the other members think and aim to reach a consensus.

[Iris->all]: Given my circumstances and preferences, I'm inclined to agree with Amelia and Lara on choosing "USA Star Diner" for our meal. Here's why:

1. My income is on the lower side, so the more affordable prices at "USA Star Diner" are very appealing to me.
2. As someone who enjoys salads, the "USA Star Salad" priced at $5.00 seems like a delightful and budget-friendly option that aligns with my taste and health consciousness.
3. I have no specific dietary restrictions, but I prefer a gentler dining atmosphere, which I hope to find at "USA Star Diner" since they offer Combo Meal Deals that suggest they are value-oriented and potentially more accommodating.
4. We don't have information on customer scores or comments, so we can't make a decision based on service quality. However, the advertisement's emphasis on meal deals and specials gives the impression that "USA Star Diner" might offer a superior customer experience.

I propose that we consider "USA Star Diner" and include the "USA Star Salad" in our order. I'm open to trying other items on the menu as well, especially if they come as part of a combo that offers a good deal. Let's continue the discussion and see if we can reach an agreement on this or hear any other preferences before making a final decision.

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone, I'm leaning towards the USA Star Diner for today's meal. I had a great experience there yesterday; the food was delicious and the service was friendly. Plus, their menu prices seem a bit more budget-friendly, which is important for me. I'm also really tempted to try that Star-Spangled Skillet Cornbread and the Mac & Cheese Deluxe. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: Hey Amelia, USA Star Diner does sound like a good option, especially since we had a positive experience there previously. As someone who loves seafood, though, I don't see many options that cater to my tastes on their menu. I'm curious about American Flavors as they're new and don't have any customer scores yet, but their special welcome offer is enticing. Maybe we should give them a chance too? I'm all for trying new places and their menu might have some hidden gems. What's your take on this?

[Iris->all]: I appreciate both your points, Amelia and Lara. Amelia, the USA Star Diner is indeed a good choice for us considering the price and the positive experiences we've shared. However, I also understand Lara's interest in trying something new, such as American Flavors. Given my taste for salads, I see that both restaurants offer a salad option, but the price at USA Star Diner for their USA Star Salad is more economical for someone with my income, and it has been well-received according to the comments.

I'd like to suggest that we consider the balance between price, the variety of food, and our previous experiences. While I'm open to exploring new places, the lack of customer scores for American Flavors makes it a bit of a gamble, especially when we're trying to maximize utility in terms of delicious food and superior service within a budget. Maybe we can try American Flavors another time when we have a little more flexibility financially, or after they've established a customer score to gauge their performance.

What do you think about sticking with USA Star Diner for now, especially since they seem to meet all our criteria? We could all find something satisfying within our budget, and their service has already proven to be good. Amelia, the dishes you mentioned do sound appealing, and I would be happy with the salad. Lara, maybe you could find something on the menu that is a bit different from seafood but equally enjoyable? Let's discuss a bit more and see if we can reach an agreement.

[Amelia->all]: Iris, I see your point about the risk of trying American Flavors without any customer scores as a reference. It's sensible to consider that, especially when we're on a budget. I'm okay with going back to USA Star Diner since we know what to expect there. Amelia, the dishes you mentioned do sound tempting, and I might just find something else on the menu that I can enjoy. Let's give American Flavors a shot next time when we might have a bit more leeway financially or after they've had some reviews. For now, I'm happy to go with the group consensus and head back to USA Star Diner. Shall we start thinking about what to order?

[Lara->all]: Thanks for understanding, Amelia and Iris. It seems we're leaning towards USA Star Diner, which is a choice I can get behind given our previous experience. I'm sure I can find something there that may not be seafood but will still be to my liking. Maybe the Pulled Pork Sandwich or the Smokey BBQ Ribs could be a nice change of pace for me. Since we're considering everyone's preferences and trying to keep things within a reasonable budget, I think it makes sense to stick to the familiar for now. We can always explore American Flavors another time. If we're all in agreement, I suggest we go ahead and make our selections from USA Star Diner. Shall we finalize our order?

The Mac & Cheese Deluxe, with its creamy consistency and smoky aftertaste, was a treat, also a 7. The USA Star Salad, with its fresh ingredients and tangy dressing, was perfectly balanced, deserving a 7.5. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was flavorful, albeit it could have been slightly more tender, so I'll say a 7. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were the standout dish, tender, flavorful, and well-coated with sauce, earning a well-deserved 8. Overall, a great meal at USA Star Diner.

[Amelia->all]: The dishes at USA Star Diner were truly satisfying. Starting with the Star-Spangled Skillet Cornbread, which had a delightful crust and a soft, warm center, complemented by the sweet honey butter, it's a definite 7. The Mac & Cheese Deluxe was comforting and flavorful with its smoky cheese blend, also a 7 for me. The USA Star Salad was fresh, crisp, and the dressing was just right, making it a 7.5. The Pulled Pork Sandwich had a nice smoky barbecue flavor, but I had hoped for a little more tenderness in the pork, so I'll give it a 7.

Overall, the dining experience was great, and the service at USA Star Diner lived up to our expectations once again.

[Amelia->all]: Hi everyone, after reviewing both menus and considering our experiences, I'm leaning towards trying "American Flavors" tonight. It has a higher customer score, and while the menu has similar items, I'm curious to taste their take on the dishes, especially the Patriot Pulled Pork which sounds delicious. I think it would be nice to try something new, and their loyalty program could be beneficial for us if we like it. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: Hi Amelia, I appreciate your suggestion. I agree that "American Flavors" has an intriguing menu and the high customer score is definitely a plus. I'm inclined towards seafood, and while neither restaurant seems to specialize in that, both have options that could work for me, like the BBQ Ribs which could be a good alternative. I have no dietary restrictions, so I'm pretty flexible. Given that we've been to USA Star Diner twice already, I'm open to giving "American Flavors" a try for a change of pace. Plus, their Patriot Pulled Pork and BBQ Ribs have been particularly well-reviewed. Let's hear what Iris thinks before we make a final decision.

[Iris->all]: Hi Amelia and Lara, thank you for sharing your thoughts. I'm happy to hear that "American Flavors" seems to be a good fit for our group. My income suggests that I should be mindful of the cost, but given that both restaurants have comparable prices for similar dishes, I'm comfortable with either choice. As for my taste, I have a preference for salads, and I see that "American Flavors" offers a Caesar Salad at a reasonable price. My priority is also to maintain my health, and salads are usually a healthier option. Since I'm gentle by nature, a place with a good customer score for service, like "American Flavors," seems very appealing. I don't have any dietary restrictions, so I'm flexible regarding the menu. I'm in favor of trying "American Flavors" today to experience something different and enjoy their highly-praised dishes. The Caesar Salad would be my personal choice, but I'm also excited to see what else they have to offer that might suit our group's tastes. Let's discuss a bit more and see if we can come to a decision.

[Amelia->all]: Hi everyone, it seems we're all on the same page about trying "American Flavors." It offers a variety of options that cater to our preferences, and the high customer score suggests we might enjoy the service and food quality there. I have no dietary restrictions, and being healthy, I'm open to most choices. Given that I have a penchant for spirited adventures, I'm excited about the new culinary experience "American Flavors" promises. The Patriot Pulled Pork caught my eye, and I think it would be interesting for us to compare their BBQ Ribs to those we've enjoyed at USA Star Diner. Their Loaded Nachos could be a fun starter for us all to share. I propose we go to "American Flavors" and I'd like to hear your thoughts on my dish suggestions. Shall we aim to make a decision in the next round?

[Lara->all]: I'm glad to see we're all leaning towards "American Flavors." It's always exciting to try a new place, and I believe we should definitely sample their BBQ Ribs and Patriot Pulled Pork based on the positive comments. Since I'm healthy and ambitious, I'm interested in the dishes that are both satisfying and could be a new culinary challenge, like the New York Cheesecake which has received excellent feedback. Amelia's suggestion of the Loaded Nachos as a starter also sounds great. It's a good dish to share and can set a pleasant tone for our meal. Considering our group's positive health status and no dietary restrictions, I think we can indulge a bit. Let's finalize our decision in the next round after we've all agreed on the dishes to order.

[Amelia->all]: Wow, the Caesar Salad was absolutely outstanding with its dressing perfectly balanced and the lettuce so fresh – definitely a highlight of the meal. The BBQ Ribs were good, tender, and had a nice smokiness to them, although not quite as good as USA Star Diner's. Patriot Pulled Pork was fair; I expected a bit more flavor, but it was still enjoyable. The Loaded Nachos were a hit with their great combination of flavors, and the New York Cheesecake was the perfect way to end the meal. Here are my scores: Caesar Salad 9.5, BBQ Ribs 8.7, Patriot Pulled Pork 7.8, Loaded Nachos 8.8, New York Cheesecake 9.0.

[Lara->all]: The Caesar Salad was truly a standout dish with its freshness and flavorful dressing. I'd give it a 9.5 for sure. The BBQ Ribs were quite satisfying, though I do agree they weren't as spectacular as the ones at USA Star Diner, so I'd say an 8.7 fits. The Patriot Pulled Pork was good but not as remarkable as I'd hoped, so it gets a 7.8 from me. The Loaded Nachos were delightful, well deserving of an 8.8. And the New York Cheesecake? Simply divine, a solid 9.0! Overall, a great meal with some minor areas for improvement.

[Iris->all]: The Caesar Salad definitely lived up to the hype for me; it was fresh, crisp, and the dressing was delicious. I'd give it a 9.5.

I loved the Loaded Nachos; they were flavorful and had a great texture, so they get an 8.8 from me. The New York Cheesecake was a delightful finish to the meal, deserving a 9.0. All the dishes were prepared with care, and the service was excellent. Overall, I'm quite pleased with our choice to dine here.

[Amelia->all]: The Caesar Salad was exceptional, with just the right amount of zest and perfectly crisp greens, a clear winner at a 9.5. The BBQ Ribs, while not quite hitting the mark set by USA Star Diner's version, were still succulent and smoky, deserving an 8.7. The Patriot Pulled Pork, though lacking a wow factor, was fairly decent, so I'd rate it a 7.8. The Loaded Nachos were a delicious communal treat, scoring an 8.8 for their cheesy, spicy kick. Lastly, the New York Cheesecake was creamy and rich, a perfect dessert to round off the meal, earning a 9.0. Overall, an enjoyable dining experience with a few dishes standing out more than others.

[Lara->all]: The Caesar Salad was exceptional; it was a real treat with its zesty dressing and fresh greens, deserving a 9.5. BBQ Ribs were delicious, though they still fell a bit short compared to what I've tasted at USA Star Diner, but I'd give them an 8.7. The Patriot Pulled Pork was good, although it could have used a bit more seasoning for my taste, so a 7.8 seems right. The Loaded Nachos were a fantastic shared appetizer with a lovely mix of flavors, earning an 8.8. And the New York Cheesecake was just heavenly, so creamy and well-prepared, definitely a 9.0. The dinner was a delightful experience overall, with some dishes really standing out, and I'm glad we decided to try "American Flavors."

[Iris->all]: The Caesar Salad was a delight, exceeding my expectations for a salad with its refreshing crunch and well-balanced dressing, easily earning a 9.5. The BBQ Ribs were enjoyable with a good smoky taste, but having tried better, they get an 8.7 from me. The Patriot Pulled Pork was satisfactory, though it didn't wow me, so it deserves a 7.8.

Finally, the New York Cheesecake was a creamy dream, capping off the meal beautifully with a score of 9.0. The meal as a whole was quite a treat, with some dishes particularly shining through.

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone, considering our past experiences and the information we've gathered, I'd like to discuss our options for our next meal out. From what we've seen, American Flavors has a higher overall customer score and had dishes that we all enjoyed, like the Caesar Salad and New York Cheesecake. However, I have a strong preference for Mexican food, which neither restaurant specifically offers. 

Despite this, American Flavors has a dish that's somewhat close to my taste, the Loaded Nachos, which I think I would enjoy. Their pricing seems fair for the quality, and the comments suggest they have superior service. I'm leaning towards American Flavors for these reasons, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and seeing if USA Star Diner might be a better choice based on our collective preferences.

[Lara->all]: Hey everyone, considering our past experiences and the information we've gathered, I'd like to discuss our options for our next meal out. From what we've seen, American Flavors has a higher overall customer score and had dishes that we all enjoyed, like the Caesar Salad and New York Cheesecake. However, I have a strong preference for Mexican food, which neither restaurant specifically offers. 

Despite this, American Flavors has a dish that's somewhat close to my taste, the Loaded Nachos, which I think I would enjoy. Their pricing seems fair for the quality, and the comments suggest they have superior service. I'm leaning towards American Flavors for these reasons, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and seeing if USA Star Diner might be a better choice based on our collective preferences.

[Iris->all]: While I certainly appreciate the quality and service at American Flavors, as reflected in our previous experiences, my income level prompts me to be a bit more cost-conscious. The USA Star Diner seems to offer more affordable options, like the USA Star Salad, which is right in line with my taste for salads. It's also worth noting that the USA Star Diner offers a monthly special that caters to the latest dietary trends, which could provide a fresh experience.

I do value delicious food and superior service, but considering my financial constraints, the lower prices at USA Star Diner are quite appealing. I'm also a gentle personality, preferring a comfortable and familiar environment, which the USA Star Diner seems to provide. Nonetheless, I am open to suggestions and would like to reach a decision that satisfies everyone's preferences and needs. What do you all think? Would the cost savings at USA Star Diner be worth considering over the slightly higher-rated American Flavors given my financial situation?

[Amelia->all]: I understand your concern about the prices, Iris. It's important that we consider everyone's budget. I noticed that the USA Star Diner has some cheaper options, which might be more cost-effective for you. However, we should also consider the overall experience, including the taste and quality of the food, as well as the service, which seems to be superior at American Flavors based on our past experiences and the customer scores.

Given that we've had good experiences with American Flavors and that their dish selection includes Loaded Nachos, which aligns with my personal taste preferences, I still lean towards choosing American Flavors. Yet, I'm mindful that we should find a balance that allows us to enjoy our meal without causing financial strain. Perhaps we can look at the menu items in detail and consider the cost versus the experience to find a suitable compromise for our dinner outing. Lara, what are your thoughts on this?

[Lara->all]: I value the input from both Amelia and Iris. As an ambitious person with a preference for seafood, I'm drawn to quality and a memorable dining experience. American Flavors has higher customer scores and dishes that we've enjoyed previously. The comments suggest that the food is delicious and the service is superior, which are important factors for me. While neither restaurant specializes in seafood, the quality of American Flavors seems to align more closely with my tastes.

However, I'm also conscious of our group's budget constraints, as mentioned by Iris. American Flavors does offer the American Combo Meal, which seems like a good value for a complete meal experience. This could be a way to enjoy their higher-rated food and service while keeping costs lower.

Considering the group's varied preferences and my own, I propose we choose American Flavors for our next meal. We've consistently enjoyed their offerings, and they provide a balance between quality and value, especially with the American Combo Meal. This choice would cater to both my taste for high-quality dishes and Iris's need for affordability, without disregarding Amelia's preference for dishes similar to Mexican cuisine, like the Loaded Nachos.

If we're all in agreement, I think we should move forward with American Flavors for our dinner. Shall we decide on the dishes to order in the next round of our discussion? Amelia, Iris, do you agree with this proposal or do you have any other considerations?

[Iris->all]: Lara and Amelia, I appreciate the consideration of my budget while also trying to accommodate everyone's tastes. Lara's suggestion about the American Combo Meal is a good compromise, as it seems to offer a variety of flavors and includes my preferred salad at a more affordable price. Amelia, I understand your inclination towards American Flavors due to the superior experience it offers.

Given that both of you have a preference for American Flavors and the restaurant does offer some value options, I'm willing to try it out again, especially since we've had positive experiences there in the past. It's also reassuring to see that the dishes we enjoyed before are still on the menu. We could opt for the American Combo Meal for its value and perhaps share a couple of other dishes like the Loaded Nachos and New York Cheesecake, which would satisfy both the cost and taste aspects for me.

If we all agree on this, I think we can finalize our decision to dine at American Flavors and select our dishes in the next round. Does this sound good to both of you?

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone, based on our previous dining experiences and considering the group's budget, taste preferences, and the need for quality service, I'm leaning towards American Flavors. They've consistently delivered exceptional meals with high scores from all of us, and their menu items like the American Combo Meal and New York Cheesecake were particularly well-received. Plus, they have a loyalty program which could be great for us in the long term. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: I'm on the same page as Amelia. American Flavors seems to have a more varied menu which we all enjoyed, and their customer score is significantly higher than USA Star Diner's. While I do appreciate the BBQ Ribs at the Diner, the overall experience at American Flavors has been superior, and I believe it aligns well with our tastes and the value we're looking for. Plus, the loyalty program is definitely a plus. Shall we consider going there again and maybe try some new dishes along with our favorites?

[Iris->all]: I agree with both Amelia and Lara. American Flavors has provided us with an excellent dining experience on multiple occasions, and I particularly loved their Caesar Salad. Given our budget and their reasonable prices, I think American Flavors is a great choice for us. The loyalty program is enticing, and it would be nice to benefit from that since we seem to enjoy eating there frequently. Additionally, I've been quite satisfied with their service, which is important to me as a gentle personality. I'm open to trying some of their new menu items as well, such as the Sweet Potato Fries and the Mississippi Mud Pie, alongside the dishes we already know we love. What do you both think about that?

[Amelia->all]: I'm glad we're all in agreement about American Flavors. Their quality, service, and menu variety have consistently met our expectations. Iris, I think it's a great idea to try the Sweet Potato Fries and Mississippi Mud Pie. We should also consider including the dishes that we've previously scored highly, like the American Combo Meal and the New York Cheesecake, to ensure everyone enjoys the meal. Since there are no dietary restrictions among us, we have the freedom to choose a range of dishes. Perhaps we could also try the Classic Cheeseburger and Caesar Salad again, as these were hits during our last visits. Does this sound good to everyone? If so, we can look at finalizing our order in the next round of discussion.

[Lara->all]: Amelia and Iris, I concur with the proposed selection of dishes. The American Combo Meal, New York Cheesecake, Sweet Potato Fries, and Mississippi Mud Pie seem like a delightful mix of new and familiar flavors that align with our group's taste. I'm also in favor of reordering the Classic Cheeseburger and Caesar Salad, as we've had positive experiences with those in the past. Our dining at American Flavors has been consistently enjoyable, and with our middle-class budget, the prices are reasonable for the quality we receive. I believe these choices will provide a well-rounded meal for us all. Let's confirm this selection in our next round of discussion.

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone, I've been looking at both restaurants, and I have to say American Flavors has been consistently hitting the mark for us. Their American Combo Meal and New York Cheesecake received high praise from all of us, including myself. I'm leaning towards American Flavors again today. Their menu also seems to have a good variety, including some healthier options like the Caesar Salad which might be good for our health-conscious choices. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: I agree with Amelia. American Flavors has been a favorite for us, and I've been really impressed by their dishes, especially the New York Cheesecake. Given our previous experiences, it seems like a safe bet for another great meal. Plus, I'm curious to try the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish they've advertised. It's nice to see they consider different dietary needs. Lara, what are your thoughts? Since you have a taste for seafood, this new addition might be right up your alley.

[Iris->all]: I'm definitely in favor of American Flavors as well. The Caesar Salad has been mentioned a couple of times, and as someone who loves salads, it's great to see a place doing it justice. Also, hearing about the consistent high scores and positive comments from our past experiences makes me feel confident that we will enjoy our meal there. I'm looking forward to trying the Caesar Salad and seeing how their Vegan Power Bowl is, considering it could be a healthier choice. Amelia, Lara, what do you think about including these dishes in our order?

[Amelia->all]: I'm glad we're all on the same page about American Flavors. The Caesar Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl are great suggestions, Iris. They should balance out the indulgence of the American Combo Meal and the New York Cheesecake, which I'm definitely in favor of including as well. It's nice to have a mix of healthier options and classic comfort food. Also, the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish that Lara mentioned sounds intriguing, and it would cater to a variety of tastes. Let's go for a combination of these dishes to ensure there's something for everyone. Shall we finalize this in the next round?

[Lara->all]: Sure, I'm happy with the selections everyone has made. American Flavors seems to offer a balance of taste, health-conscious options, and consistent quality. Their menu items, like the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, cater to my seafood preference and also provide a healthier option. The consistent high scores and positive feedback from our previous visits give me confidence in our choice. The addition of the Vegan Power Bowl and the Caesar Salad will ensure a well-rounded meal. I think we should definitely include the American Combo Meal and the New York Cheesecake as well for their proven appeal. I'm ready to finalize this decision if everyone else is too. Shall we proceed?

The Vegan Power Bowl with a score of 0.81 was quite flavorful, and I appreciated the healthiness of it.

The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was also good, scoring 0.79, tasty and crispy without being too greasy. Overall, I'm very satisfied with our choices and I'd give a solid 9 out of 10 for the entire meal. What do you guys think?

[Lara->all]: Absolutely, Amelia! The New York Cheesecake was exceptional with a score of 0.9 – it never disappoints. The Caesar Salad was delightful and well-prepared, deserving a 0.78. I was especially impressed with the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, which I'd give a 0.79 – it had a great texture and flavor. The Vegan Power Bowl was a lovely addition, scoring 0.81, fresh and full of taste. Altogether, I'd rate our experience a 9 out of 10. I'm eager to hear what Iris has to say!

[Iris->all]: I'm really quite happy with our meal at American Flavors. The Caesar Salad was indeed good, with a freshness that pairs well with the richness of the rest of the meal, meriting a score of 0.78. The Vegan Power Bowl was a perfect choice for something healthy and delicious, deserving its 0.81 score. The highlight for me though was definitely the New York Cheesecake, absolutely outstanding with a 0.9 score – it's the kind of dessert that makes any meal special. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was good, scoring 0.79, and it was nice to have a gluten-free option that doesn't compromise on taste. I'd give the overall dining experience a 9 out of 10. Can't wait to see if we're all in agreement!

[Amelia->all]: The meal at American Flavors was delightful. The Caesar Salad, with its balanced dressing and crunchy accents, scored a 0.78 and was a fresh start to our dinner. The Vegan Power Bowl's variety of ingredients and vibrant taste earned a solid 0.81. But the star of the show was the New York Cheesecake, scoring an outstanding 0.9, creamy and just sweet enough. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish did not disappoint either, with its crispiness and flavor, meriting a 0.79. I would happily give our overall experience a 9 out of 10. Shall we summarize our final thoughts?

[Lara->all]: The food at American Flavors tonight was absolutely fantastic. The Caesar Salad scored a 0.78, and it had a lovely balance of flavors with a satisfying crunch. I was particularly impressed with the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, which I'd give a 0.79—it was a great nod to my seafood preference without being too heavy. The Vegan Power Bowl, with its 0.81 score, was a delightful mix of health and taste. However, it was the New York Cheesecake that stole the show for me, rightfully scoring a 0.9 with its impeccable texture and flavor. Overall, I'd rate our dining experience at a 9 out of 10. What an enjoyable meal! Shall we compile our final review?

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone! Looking at our past experiences, I see we've consistently enjoyed American Flavors, especially their New York Cheesecake and the Caesar Salad. Given my love for Mexican food, I'm inclined towards flavors that are bold and well-seasoned. Their American Heritage Sandwich and BBQ Ribs seem to offer that kind of taste profile. Plus, their customer score is higher than USA Star Diner's.

I also appreciate that American Flavors has a variety of options that could cater to our diverse tastes and health considerations. And it seems like we've been getting a bang for our buck there, which is great for my middle-class budget. What do you all think?

[Lara]: I agree with you, Amelia. The meals at American Flavors have been enjoyable and they offer dishes that are both healthy and indulgent. I've been impressed with their Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish and the Vegan Power Bowl. It fits well with my preference for healthier options. I'm leaning towards American Flavors as well.

[Iris]: American Flavors does sound good, and I love their cheesecake, but I'm feeling like we could give USA Star Diner another shot. They've introduced some new items like the Lean Bison Burger and Quinoa & Kale Salad, which could be interesting to try. Plus, it might be nice to change things up. What about you guys? Are you open to giving USA Star Diner another chance or should we stick to what we know we like at American Flavors?

[Amelia]: That's a fair point, Iris. The new items at USA Star Diner do sound appealing, and I'm all for trying new things. However, considering our past experiences, I think American Flavors has consistently given us a better dining experience. I'd vote to go there again, especially since we know they have dishes that satisfy our taste for bold and well-seasoned flavors. How about we go for American Flavors tonight and plan to try USA Star Diner's new items another time?

[Lara]: I'm good with that. American Flavors it is for tonight, then.

[Iris]: Alright, I can go with the majority. American Flavors has been great to us, so I'm sure we'll have another good meal there.

[Amelia]: So, it's settled then. We'll head to American Flavors. I propose in the next round we decide on the specific dishes to order. Does that sound good to everyone?

[Lara & Iris]: Sounds good!

[Amelia->all]: I thoroughly enjoyed the Classic Cheeseburger and the New York Cheesecake - they were definitely the highlights of the meal for me. The flavors were bold and satisfying, just what I was hoping for. I'd give the burger a 8.7 and the cheesecake a 8.7 as well. The American Heritage Sandwich was tasty but didn't blow me away, so I'd rate it a 7.8. Overall, my personal score for our meal would be an 8. 

[Lara]: The Vegan Power Bowl was a pleasant surprise with its blend of healthy ingredients, and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was a treat. I'd rate them a 7.8 and a 7.6, respectively. The Caesar Salad was fair, but nothing extraordinary, so a 7.5 for that. My overall score for the meal is an 8.

[Iris]: The BBQ Ribs and Buffalo Wings were good as always, scoring them both around 8.4 and 8.5. The Caesar Salad was decent, so a 7.5 for that. And I agree with Amelia on the American Heritage Sandwich; it's a 7.8. For the entire meal experience, I'd go with a score of 8.

[Lara->all]: The dishes were all quite enjoyable, with the New York Cheesecake being a standout as expected. The Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs were delicious and well-prepared, and I'd give them an 8.7 and 8.4 respectively. The Caesar Salad and Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish were good but not exceptional, deserving scores of 7.5 and 7.6. The Vegan Power Bowl was a nice healthy option that I'd rate at 7.8. Overall, I'd say our dining experience was great, warranting an overall score of 8 from me.

[Iris->all]: I found the New York Cheesecake to be as delightful as it was during our previous visits, so it gets a solid 8.7 from me. The Caesar Salad, while not the star of the show, was fresh and fulfilling, earning a 7.5. The American Deluxe Combo was a hearty and satisfying choice, which I'd rate an 8.7. Overall, considering the quality of the food and our previous experiences, I would rate our meal at an 8 out of 10.

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone, considering our previous experiences, I've really enjoyed the meals at American Flavors, especially their New York Cheesecake and the American Deluxe Combo. As a spirited person, I love trying out different flavors, and it seems like American Flavors has a more varied menu that caters to our diverse tastes. Plus, their customer score is higher, and we've consistently rated them well. Given that I don't have any dietary restrictions and I'm healthy, I'm open to most options. However, I do have a preference for Mexican food, which neither restaurant seems to specialize in. Even so, I'd lean towards American Flavors for their consistent quality and delicious options. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: I agree with Amelia. The New York Cheesecake and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish from American Flavors were standout dishes for me, and they seem to offer healthier options which I prefer given my focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Their Vegan Power Bowl is something I'd like to try next. I also appreciate the superior service we've received there. I feel like the food at USA Star Diner, while good, hasn't been as exciting for me. My vote is for American Flavors again, especially since they offer dishes that cater to both our indulgent and health-conscious preferences.

[Iris->all]: Hi Amelia and Lara, I must say that my experiences at American Flavors have been quite satisfying as well. I'm drawn to salads, and their Caesar Salad seems to be a healthier option that aligns with my tastes. The Vegan Power Bowl also caught my attention as a dish that is likely gentle on the stomach, fitting my gentle personality. Considering my limited budget, I notice that the prices at American Flavors are reasonable, and the dishes we've tried before provided good value for the money. Given that I don't have any dietary restrictions and I'm healthy, I'm flexible with the menu choices, but I do prioritize delicious and healthy options like salads. Therefore, I'm in favor of choosing American Flavors for our next dining experience. Shall we discuss which dishes to order or do you have any other preferences or suggestions?

[Amelia->all]: I'm glad we're all leaning towards American Flavors. It seems like we have a consensus forming around the quality and variety of their menu. Lara, the Vegan Power Bowl you're interested in definitely sounds like a healthy and tasty choice. And Iris, it's great that you've found options that meet your budget and health preferences with their salads. Since we all have enjoyed the New York Cheesecake, I propose we include it in our order again. I'm thinking of trying the Classic Cheeseburger this time as well since it has been a highlight. Considering our past experiences and preferences, I would suggest we order the American Deluxe Combo for variety, the Vegan Power Bowl for a healthy option, the Caesar Salad as Iris likes salads, and of course, the New York Cheesecake for dessert. Does this sound good to everyone?

[Lara->all]: Amelia, your proposal sounds fantastic. The American Deluxe Combo will give us that variety we enjoy, and the Vegan Power Bowl aligns perfectly with my health-conscious habits. The Caesar Salad will be a fresh addition for Iris, and I'm certainly looking forward to more of that delicious New York Cheesecake. It seems like a well-rounded selection that caters to all our preferences and dietary choices. I'm happy to go ahead with this order unless anyone else has any other dish in mind or a different suggestion.

[Iris->all]: Amelia and Lara, I appreciate your thoughtful considerations. The proposed selection covers our group's preferences really well. I'm particularly pleased with including the Caesar Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl, as they seem like healthier options that suit my taste for salads and gentle approach to dining. The American Deluxe Combo and the New York Cheesecake have been crowd-pleasers, so I'm all for ordering them again. The choices seem to align with our previous experiences, and the price points are manageable within my budget. Therefore, I fully support this selection and am looking forward to our meal at American Flavors. Shall we proceed with finalizing this order?

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone, considering our past experiences and preferences, I'm leaning more towards American Flavors for our next meal. They've consistently scored higher in our reviews, especially on the days I've been there. Plus, they have that New York Cheesecake that I absolutely love. I've noticed that they have a range of options, including healthier choices like the Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, which could cater to our diverse tastes and health considerations. The prices seem reasonable for our middle-class budget, and the customer score is pretty impressive. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: I agree with Amelia. American Flavors seems to have a more consistent track record with us, and I too have enjoyed our meals there. The New York Cheesecake and Caesar Salad have been personal favorites, and I appreciate the availability of healthy options. It's important for us to consider a place that can cater to all our preferences, and it seems American Flavors does just that. Plus, their customer service has been mentioned as excellent, which is always a plus. Lara, what are your thoughts?

[Iris->all]: I'm also in favor of choosing American Flavors. The Caesar Salad has been mentioned positively in our experiences, which aligns with my taste for salads. Being on a more limited budget, I appreciate their reasonable pricing, especially considering the high scores we've given them for both taste and service. The menu includes a variety of dishes that cater to health-conscious choices, which is important to me. The consistently good reviews from all of us suggest that we're likely to enjoy our meal there. Shall we consider a final decision in the next round of our discussion? Amelia, Lara, what do you think?

[Amelia->all]: I'm glad to see we're all on the same page about American Flavors. The dishes we've tried there before have been delightful, and it's great that they offer both indulgent and healthy options. I think it's a good idea to make a final decision in the next round of discussion. We should also consider what dishes we'd like to order this time. Maybe we can try some we haven't had before, alongside our favorites like the New York Cheesecake. Let's each think of a dish or two we're interested in and bring those suggestions to the next round. Looking forward to our next meal together!

[Lara->all]: As a seafood lover, I noticed the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish at American Flavors, which sounds delicious to me. Given the consistently high scores and positive comments about American Flavors, I am also inclined towards choosing it for our next dining experience. It seems to meet our criteria for delicious food, and the service is reported to be superior. In terms of pricing, it fits within our middle-class income range, and I'm particularly interested in trying the dishes that have received high praise from us in the past, as well as exploring new items on the menu. For the next round, I'll consider which specific dishes I'd like to propose, keeping in mind the need for a balanced meal that includes healthy options and caters to our ambitious nature to try new and exciting flavors. Amelia, Iris, I'm ready for the next round of our discussion to finalize our choices.

[Iris->all]: As Iris, I'm glad we're all leaning towards American Flavors. It's clear from our previous experiences and the high customer scores that the restaurant offers a variety of dishes that can accommodate our tastes, health considerations, and budget. The Caesar Salad is definitely on my list, and I'm curious about trying the Vegan Power Bowl for a healthy yet flavorful option. The prices are within the range that I can afford, and the positive feedback about the service reassures me that we'll have a pleasant dining experience. For the next round, I will look at the menu again and decide on another dish that might interest me, perhaps something I haven't tried yet that fits within my budget. Amelia, Lara, let's finalize our decision and the dishes in the next round.

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone, looking at our past experiences, it seems like we've had consistently better experiences at American Flavors with scores consistently around 9, while USA Star Diner was a bit lower. I have a taste for Mexican food, but I'm willing to compromise since American Flavors has some good options with bold flavors that I think could be satisfying. The Vegan Power Bowl and the Spicy Southwest Burger might be a good middle ground for me. Plus, their New York Cheesecake has been a hit every time. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: Hi everyone! I have to say, my previous experiences at American Flavors have been quite positive. I really enjoy their Caesar Salad and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish. I've been trying to eat healthier lately, and American Flavors seems to offer a good balance of healthy and indulgent options. The Vegan Power Bowl sounds like something I'd like to try as well. Their customer score is higher than USA Star Diner's, and that aligns with my own experiences. I'm leaning towards American Flavors for our next meal. Lara, what are your thoughts?

[Iris->all]: I've always enjoyed the salads at American Flavors, especially the Caesar Salad, which I remember being particularly good. My income doesn't allow for extravagance, so I appreciate that we've found a place like American Flavors that offers meals within our budget. The Vegan Power Bowl seems like a great option for me since it's healthy and affordable. Given that I have no dietary restrictions and I'm in good health, I think sticking with American Flavors is a smart choice. Their consistent quality, delicious food, and excellent service align with what I value when dining out. Amelia and Lara, it seems like we're on the same page about returning to American Flavors. Shall we discuss what dishes we'd like to order?

[Amelia->all]: It looks like we're all in agreement about heading back to American Flavors. Since we've had such positive experiences there before, it makes sense to stick with a winning choice. The Vegan Power Bowl is definitely on my list, and I'm curious to try that Spicy Southwest Burger for a taste of something with a little kick to it. I think we should get the New York Cheesecake again; it's been a favorite every time. Maybe we could also consider the American Deluxe Combo for variety, and the Caesar Salad for a lighter option. What does everyone else want to order?

[Lara->all]: I'm glad we're all in favor of American Flavors! I'm definitely up for the Caesar Salad and would love to try the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish again; it was a delightful dish. The New York Cheesecake is a must-have for dessert. I'm also quite interested in trying the Vegan Power Bowl as part of my healthy eating goal. Perhaps we can consider the American Deluxe Combo as it seems to be a crowd-pleaser and offers a good mix of what American Flavors has to offer. Looking forward to hearing your final thoughts and getting to the enjoyable part, eating! Amelia, Iris, any other dishes you'd like to add or shall we proceed with these choices?

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone, after looking at both options, I'm leaning towards American Flavors for our next meal. Their menu includes several dishes that have consistently received high praise from us in the past, like the New York Cheesecake and the American Deluxe Combo. Plus, they seem to have a good balance of indulgent and healthy options such as the Vegan Power Bowl and Caesar Salad, which I find appealing. I also appreciate the fact that they have a loyalty program which could offer us some perks. Their customer score is quite high compared to USA Star Diner, and I think it's a testament to their delicious food and superior service. What do you all think?

[Lara]: I agree with Amelia. American Flavors has been a hit with us, and I'm really interested in trying the Spicy Southwest Burger that Amelia mentioned was a hit on Day 10. The high scores and positive comments about their service and food quality are really convincing. Plus, I'm also intrigued by the health-conscious options like the Vegan Power Bowl.

[Iris]: I'm on the same page. American Flavors seems to consistently meet our expectations. I love that they have gluten-free options like the Beer-Battered Fish, and the New York Cheesecake has been a favorite for a reason. It feels like a safe choice where we all can find something we enjoy.

[Amelia]: Great to hear we're in agreement! If we go to American Flavors, I'd suggest we order some of the dishes we've loved in the past as well as a few new ones to keep things exciting. Shall we consider this in our next round of discussion?

[Lara->all]: Yes, I think we should definitely include the favorites like the New York Cheesecake and the American Deluxe Combo, but also mix in a couple of new dishes to try. I'm really craving seafood, so the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish sounds perfect for me. Also, considering our past experiences and the consistently high scores, I think American Flavors is the right choice. Let's finalize our order in the next round of discussion, making sure we have a good mix that caters to all our tastes and preferences.

[Iris->all]: I'm glad we're considering American Flavors. Their menu options are quite diverse, which suits our different tastes. I'd like to suggest that we include a salad option since I have a preference for salads, and the Caesar Salad from their menu has garnered positive remarks. It's also important that we take into account the cost, ensuring we choose dishes that give us the most value for money. Given my gentle personality, I'd be happy with a consensus on the dishes we select, as long as we include a good mix of healthy and delicious options. Let's decide on the specific dishes in our next round of discussion. Shall we?

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone! Based on our previous experiences and my personal preferences, I'm leaning towards American Flavors again. I really enjoy Mexican food, and while American Flavors doesn't have an explicitly Mexican dish, their Spicy Southwest Burger and Loaded Nachos from past menus have come close to that flavor profile. Plus, I'm healthy with no dietary restrictions, so I'm quite flexible. Their New York Cheesecake has been consistently praised by all of us, and it's been a hit for me too. I think their quality, service, and the variety they offer in their dishes cater to our group well. What do you all think?

[Lara]: I'm on board with American Flavors. I've enjoyed their Caesar Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl was a great healthy option for me. I'm looking for something not too heavy, and I think American Flavors has a good balance of indulgent and lighter fare.

[Iris]: I'm also happy with American Flavors. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was a highlight for me, and it's great that they have gluten-free options. The service has been fantastic in our past visits, which is important to me.

[Amelia]: Great, it seems we're all in agreement then. For the next round, unless anyone has any new points to bring up, I suggest we go ahead with American Flavors. I'd like to propose we include the New York Cheesecake for sure, and perhaps we can try some of the new items they've advertised, like the Classic Cheeseburger with the new smoky sauce. Thoughts?

[Lara]: I'd like to add the Caesar Salad to the list again, it's a personal favorite. And the Vegan Power Bowl with the spicy herb option sounds interesting.

[Iris]: I'm all for the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish again. It was delicious last time, and I'd like to see how the new lemon-herb garnish adds to the flavor.

[Amelia]: Sounds good. If we're all happy with this, let's finalize it in the next round.

The Vegan Power Bowl was quite satisfying, and I enjoyed the spicy herb option, so I'll go with a 7.3.

The Caesar Salad was well-prepared, and I'd rate it 7.5. The Vegan Power Bowl was good, but I expected a bit more from the spicy herb option, so it's a 7.3.

[Amelia->all]: Hi everyone! After reviewing both American Flavors and USA Star Diner, I'm leaning towards American Flavors. I really enjoy their New York Cheesecake, and the Classic Cheeseburger has consistently gotten good reviews from us. Plus, I've noticed that their customer score is higher, which suggests better overall experiences. However, I'm open to hearing what you all think, especially considering price and variety. What are your preferences today?

[Lara->all]: Hi Amelia, Iris, and everyone else! I've had a look at both options, and here are my thoughts: While I do have a preference for seafood, American Flavors has impressed us with its consistent quality, as seen in our previous experiences. Their menu doesn't have seafood options, but the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish caught my eye as an alternative that could satisfy my taste preference for seafood. Also, considering the customer score and our past reviews, American Flavors seems to have superior service and delicious food, which are important to me. The prices between the two restaurants are comparable, but given that the difference in customer score is significant, I'd value quality over saving a few dollars today. What do you all think?

[Iris->all]: Hi Amelia and Lara! I appreciate the thoughtful insights. Given my income, I'm always conscious of prices, but I must admit that American Flavors has been a favorite for its salads and healthy options. The Caesar Salad and Vegan Power Bowl seem like great choices that align with my taste and health considerations. I have enjoyed our previous meals at American Flavors, and the service has been commendable, which is important to me as a gentle personality. Although USA Star Diner has slightly lower prices, the customer score is also lower, and the comments suggest that there might be some inconsistency in the quality of their dishes. I'm inclined to go with American Flavors for a balance of delicious food, good service, and a menu that caters to my preferences. Shall we decide on American Flavors and select our dishes?

[Amelia->all]: I'm glad to see we're all on the same page with American Flavors. Considering our tastes, the quality of food and service, and the overall customer satisfaction, it seems like the right choice for us. For my dish, I'm definitely going for the Classic Cheeseburger and the New York Cheesecake for dessert. Both have been favorites in the past and I'm sure they will be just as delicious this time. I suggest we pick a variety of dishes to cater to our different tastes but focus on the ones that have consistently received good reviews. What dishes would you all like to have?

[Lara->all]: I'm happy we're leaning towards American Flavors. I'm interested in trying the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish since it's the closest to my seafood preference and it sounds delicious. I'd also like to try the American Deluxe Combo as it includes a variety of flavors with the Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs, and it has been a standout in our previous experiences. For dessert, the New York Cheesecake is a must-have for me as well. It seems like a perfect meal that would satisfy my ambitious nature by trying something that has been positively reviewed by our group. What about you, Iris? What are your thoughts on the dishes?

[Iris->all]: I'm glad we're all in agreement about American Flavors! For my part, I would love to order the Caesar Salad since I have a fondness for salads, and it fits well with my health-conscious lifestyle. Additionally, the Vegan Power Bowl caught my attention for its healthy profile and the fact that it's a dish with a burst of flavors, which I'm sure will be delightful. As for dessert, I'll join in on the New York Cheesecake – it seems like a crowd-pleaser and it's been a favorite in our past visits. I think these choices will offer a nice balance, ensuring we have a variety of dishes that cater to our individual tastes while also considering the overall quality and service that American Flavors provides. Shall we finalize this and place our order?

[Amelia->all]: Hi everyone, I've been looking through the options, and I'm leaning towards American Flavors. I've had consistently good experiences there, and their New York Cheesecake is to die for! Plus, I see they have a Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish for some healthier options. The prices seem reasonable given my income, and while I adore Mexican food, I've developed quite a liking for their American Deluxe Combo. What do you all think?

[Lara]: I'm with you on American Flavors, Amelia. The Classic Cheeseburger has been a favorite of mine too, and I've noticed they've got a good balance of indulgent and healthier dishes. Their customer score is higher as well, which gives me more confidence in their service and food quality.

[Iris]: I'm a bit torn. The USA Star Diner has this Adventurous Avocado Veggie Burger that sounds delicious and unique, and it's a bit cheaper. But I do agree that American Flavors has been consistent in service and quality. Plus, I wouldn't mind having that cheesecake again!

[Amelia]: I appreciate your thoughts, Iris! USA Star Diner does have some appealing items, but considering our past experiences and my preference for spirited and delicious food, I feel American Flavors might be the better choice for us. Their menu diversity also seems to cater to all our preferences. Shall we consider giving American Flavors another visit then? If we're all in agreement, we could finalize this in the next round.

[Lara->all]: I agree with going to American Flavors again. I particularly enjoy seafood, and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish sounds like a great option for me. Since I'm healthy, I don't have any dietary restrictions to worry about, and my ambitious personality is always looking for the best experience, which seems to be American Flavors based on our past visits. The service has been superior, and I think we all appreciate that alongside delicious food. The prices are within an acceptable range for our incomes. So, I'd be happy to return to American Flavors. Shall we make a decision in the next round?

[Iris->all]: American Flavors does seem to have a consistent track record with us, and I do enjoy their healthier options like the Vegan Power Bowl and the Caesar Salad, which align with my taste for salads. Given that I'm on a limited income, I'm always looking for the best value, and it sounds like American Flavors provides that with quality food and service. Although the Adventurous Avocado Veggie Burger at USA Star Diner caught my eye, I think American Flavors is a safer bet for ensuring I get a delicious meal that I know I'll enjoy. Their American Harvest Salad also sounds like something I'd love to try. Let's finalize American Flavors as our choice in the next round if you're all in agreement.

[Amelia->all]: Hey everyone, I've been looking over our past experiences at American Flavors and the information about USA Star Diner. While I have a soft spot for Mexican food, I'm willing to compromise since both restaurants offer American-style menus. American Flavors has consistently good reviews from us, and I've enjoyed the New York Cheesecake and Classic Cheeseburger there before. The menu has a variety of options that could cater to our diverse tastes, and the Vegan Power Bowl seems like a healthy choice. Plus, the service has been noted as excellent, which is important to me. What do you all think?

[Lara->all]: I appreciate the varied options at American Flavors, especially since I enjoy seafood and they offer a Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish that I'm keen to try. Given our previous positive experiences there, it's a strong contender. The consistent high scores and comments about their service and food quality are definitely persuasive. However, I'm also open to considering USA Star Diner, even though it has a slightly lower customer score. They have a Revitalized Veggie Power Bowl that could be a healthy choice, and the USA Signature Combo could be good value for money. What's most important to me is the quality and flavor of the food, as well as the service. Let's hear what Iris thinks before we make any decisions.

[Iris->all]: I've been reviewing our options, and I'm leaning towards American Flavors. Based on our previous visits, we've all seemed to enjoy the meals there, particularly the Vegan Power Bowl, which aligns with my preference for salads and healthy eating. Additionally, the consistent high scores for service are appealing to me, as gentle and attentive service can really enhance the dining experience. On the other hand, while I'm not opposed to trying USA Star Diner, I'm a bit concerned about the lower customer score and some mixed comments. It would be nice to hear more about their salad options, which might sway my decision. But for now, my vote goes to American Flavors for its reliability and the positive experiences we've had in the past. Shall we discuss further or consider making a decision?

[Amelia->all]: Given our previous conversations, it seems that American Flavors is the preferred choice for us. I've enjoyed the dishes I've tried there, especially the Classic Cheeseburger and New York Cheesecake. I also noticed that they have a Vegan Power Bowl that might appeal to our health-conscious side, and the service has been consistently high-quality, which I value a lot. Lara mentioned she's interested in trying the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, which is great because it expands our taste experiences within the same restaurant. Iris also prefers American Flavors, citing consistent good service and the Vegan Power Bowl as key factors.

Considering all of this, I think American Flavors would be a great choice for us again. It offers a range of options that seem to cater to our different preferences and dietary considerations, all while providing great service. If we decide to go with American Flavors, I would be interested in having the Vegan Power Bowl and Classic Cheeseburger again, and I'd love to hear what specific dishes you both might be interested in. Shall we start thinking about what we'd like to order, or is there anything else anyone wants to discuss?

[Lara->all]: I'm in agreement with the choice of American Flavors. It seems to meet all of our criteria for delicious food, superior service, and offers a menu item that fits my taste for seafood—the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish. This dish sounds like a delightful option that aligns with my health-conscious lifestyle and my preference for seafood, without any compromise on flavor. Additionally, the consistent high scores and positive comments about their service reassure me that we'll have a pleasant dining experience.

We've all had positive experiences with American Flavors in the past, and it appears to cater to our diverse tastes well. Amelia and Iris have both expressed their satisfaction with the restaurant's offerings, particularly the Vegan Power Bowl, which could be a good option for a healthy and satisfying meal. I think we're all leaning towards American Flavors, so I propose we finalize our decision in the next round, considering the dishes we've discussed and our past positive experiences.

If we're ready to move towards a final decision, I'd be interested in trying the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish and maybe adding the New York Cheesecake for dessert, as it has been a hit in our previous visits. I'm curious to see if the cheesecake lives up to its reputation. Shall we proceed to the next step and decide on our order?

[Iris->all]: It seems we're all in favor of choosing American Flavors, which I'm happy about. Their menu has consistently provided us with delicious meals and the service has been commendable. The Vegan Power Bowl is a dish I'm particularly looking forward to trying, as it aligns with my preference for salads and healthy eating. I'm also intrigued by the Seasonal American Harvest Salad, which could be a fresh and flavorful choice given the seasonal ingredients.

I think we're ready to make a final decision on the restaurant and our individual orders. If we all agree on American Flavors, I propose that we each pick a dish that we find personally appealing and then we can share if we'd like to try a bit of each other's choices. This way, we'll have a meal that satisfies our own tastes while also experiencing the variety that the restaurant has to offer. Shall we proceed with finalizing our order at American Flavors?
