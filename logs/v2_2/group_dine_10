[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant. If you don't make choices, return 'None'>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.
    ],
    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>
}
(If you want to summarize, only output this json data, without any other content!!!)

[Rachel->all]: Given my income, taste, health, and dietary restrictions, I would like to discuss the options available at both "American Flavors" and "USA Star Diner." As a sophisticated gourmet with a preference for dairy-free dishes due to lactose intolerance, I am inclined towards options that cater to my dietary needs while also offering a fine dining experience.

Looking at the menus, "American Flavors" has a Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs, which may not suit my dairy-free diet due to the cheese and potential dairy in the BBQ sauce. However, the Caesar Salad could be a possibility if the dressing is dairy-free, which is often not the case. The Apple Pie and New York Cheesecake are also not suitable due to the dairy content.

On the other hand, "USA Star Diner" offers a Classic American Burger that could possibly be modified to exclude any dairy, and the Smokey BBQ Ribs might be an option if the sauce is dairy-free. The USA Star Salad could be a safe choice, and the Pulled Pork Sandwich might be suitable if the coleslaw doesnâ€™t contain dairy. Additionally, the New York Cheesecake is not an option for me, but the Iced Americano would be a perfect beverage choice.

In the first round of discussion, I would express my preference for "USA Star Diner" due to the potentially more accommodating options for my dietary restrictions and their more reasonable prices. I'd like to hear others' preferences and dietary needs before making a final decision.

In the second round, if "USA Star Diner" seems to be a preferred option among the group, I would propose ordering the USA Star Salad, the Classic American Burger without cheese, and the Iced Americano. If others agree, we could move to the third round for a final decision. If there are other preferences or dietary requirements to consider, I'm open to discussing alternative dishes.

[Ruby->all]: As an affluent individual with a discerning palate and a preference for sushi, I am looking for a dining experience that offers not just good value but exceptional quality. Health is also a priority for me, so I'm seeking dishes that are fresh and well-prepared. Neither "American Flavors" nor "USA Star Diner" specializes in sushi, but they do offer American classics with some variations.

After reviewing both menus, "American Flavors" presents more premium-priced items with descriptions that suggest a focus on tradition and quality. However, the menu at "USA Star Diner" is more reasonably priced, which might indicate better value, and they also offer combo meal deals that could be of interest.

For the first round of discussion, I would like to propose that we consider the freshness and quality of ingredients, which is crucial for a satisfying meal. Although "USA Star Diner" has more attractively priced options, I would be interested to know if they match "American Flavors" in terms of food quality.

In the second round, if we find that "USA Star Diner" can provide meals that satisfy the group's desire for quality and taste while also offering better prices, I would lean towards dining there. I would suggest the USA Star Salad for a fresh, healthy option, and perhaps the Smokey BBQ Ribs if they are known for their quality. The Iced Americano would be a refreshing drink to accompany the meal.

Before making a final decision in the third round, I'd like to hear the group's thoughts on the quality of dishes offered by both restaurants, and whether the service at either establishment is known to be superior, as this could significantly affect our dining experience.

[Hugo->all]: In examining the options at both "American Flavors" and "USA Star Diner," I am looking for a restaurant that can offer gourmet burgers, considering my taste preferences and healthy lifestyle. Price is not a primary concern given my affluent status, but I do seek quality and service that matches the price point.

"American Flavors" offers a Classic Cheeseburger that appeals to my gourmet burger preference. The description suggests a focus on quality ingredients, which is promising. However, "USA Star Diner" also has a Classic American Burger at a lower price point, which could indicate good value for money. 

For the first round of discussion, I am leaning towards "American Flavors" because of the allure of a potentially superior gourmet burger experience. However, I am open to considering "USA Star Diner" if the group can provide compelling reasons regarding its food quality and service standards.

In the second round, if there is a consensus that "USA Star Diner" offers comparable quality in their burger and overall dining experience, I would be open to choosing it for the meal. The significant price difference could be a decisive factor if the quality and service are on par with "American Flavors."

Before making a final decision, I would like to discuss further with the group and consider any known information about the service quality at both establishments, as superior service is an important aspect of the dining experience for me. Additionally, I want to ensure that everyone's dietary restrictions and taste preferences are accommodated in our choice.

[Henry->all]: As an affluent individual with a healthy appetite for meat and a reserved personality, I'm inclined to prioritize the quality of food and service over the price, although getting a reasonable deal is always appreciated. I have no dietary restrictions, which provides me with the flexibility to enjoy a wide range of dishes.

From the menus of "American Flavors" and "USA Star Diner," both have appealing meat-based options such as the BBQ Ribs and the Classic Cheeseburger or American Burger. However, the advertisements and menus suggest that "American Flavors" might focus more on traditional and premium dishes, while "USA Star Diner" seems to offer better pricing, especially with their combo meal deals.

For the first round of our discussion, I would express my interest in exploring the quality of the BBQ Ribs from "American Flavors," as their description suggests a premium experience which aligns with my taste for meat. However, the more wallet-friendly options at "USA Star Diner" are enticing, and I would consider the Smokey BBQ Ribs there if they are comparable in taste and quality.

In the second round, I would take into account the group's feedback on the quality and service of both restaurants. If "USA Star Diner" can provide an excellent dining experience with their Smokey BBQ Ribs and other dishes at a more attractive price point, I would be inclined to support dining there. The Pulled Pork Sandwich also catches my attention as a potentially delightful choice.

Before we make a final decision in the third round, I would like to hear more about everyone's preferences and the service reputation of both establishments. As service is an important factor for me, I would favor the restaurant known for its superior customer care, assuming the food quality is not compromised. I look forward to hearing the group's insights and reaching a consensus that satisfies all our criteria.

[Rachel->all]: Given the input from Ruby, Hugo, and Henry, it appears that we all share an interest in quality and a satisfactory dining experience. While price is a consideration for some, it is not the overriding factor for our affluent group. Additionally, we are collectively open to exploring options that cater to my dietary restrictions.

In this second round of discussion, I would like to propose that we consider "USA Star Diner" for our meal. The diner offers a variety of dishes at more reasonable prices compared to "American Flavors," and given the descriptions, it seems they do not compromise on quality. The Classic American Burger can be modified to be dairy-free to accommodate my lactose intolerance, and the USA Star Salad offers a fresh and healthy option for Ruby, who prioritizes health. Hugo's preference for a gourmet burger experience could potentially be met by the Classic American Burger's quality, especially if we confirm that the ingredients are of high standard. Henry's interest in meat dishes could be satisfied with the Smokey BBQ Ribs, assuming they are of premium quality.

It's important to note that none of us have mentioned the service quality of either establishment, which suggests that we have no prior knowledge or preference based on service. Therefore, our decision should primarily focus on the quality and suitability of the food options.

If the group agrees with this proposal, we could potentially finalize our decision in the third round to dine at "USA Star Diner" and select dishes that align with our individual tastes and dietary needs. If there are any objections or additional considerations, we should address them now before proceeding to the final decision.

[Ruby->all]: Reflecting on the discussions so far, it seems we are collectively leaning towards "USA Star Diner" based on the variety of options that cater to our diverse preferences and dietary needs, as well as the more reasonable pricing structure. The quality of food is a priority for all of us, and while "American Flavors" offers premium dishes, the value proposition at "USA Star Diner" is compelling, especially with the potential for a satisfying gourmet burger that Hugo is seeking and the meaty selection that Henry is drawn to.

In this second round, I would like to propose "USA Star Diner" as our dining choice. The menu seems to offer flexibility for Rachel's dairy-free requirements, and the Classic American Burger and Smokey BBQ Ribs could potentially meet the discerning tastes of Hugo and Henry. For myself, the USA Star Salad appears to be a fresh, healthy choice that aligns with my preference for high-quality ingredients. The lower pricing does not seem to indicate a compromise in quality but rather suggests good value, which is an important factor for a discerning customer like myself.

Regarding the service, since no one has prior knowledge or specific expectations, we should consider the food quality and our dietary preferences as the main criteria for our decision.

If there is a consensus on this proposal, we can finalize our decision in the third round. If there are any further thoughts or considerations, we should discuss them now to ensure that our final decision reflects the needs and preferences of the entire group.

[Hugo->all]: Considering the discussions from Rachel, Ruby, Henry, and my own perspective, it seems that "USA Star Diner" has emerged as a leading contender for our dining experience. The diner offers a more affordable menu with options that can be adapted to our varying preferences and dietary requirements. While I initially leaned towards "American Flavors" for a gourmet burger, the potential for a high-quality burger at "USA Star Diner" at a more reasonable price is appealing. 

Rachel's dairy-free needs can be accommodated with a modified Classic American Burger and the USA Star Salad. Ruby's emphasis on the freshness and quality of ingredients could likely be met by the salad and the Smokey BBQ Ribs. Henry's interest in meat dishes and quality seems to align with the offerings at "USA Star Diner" as well.

Given that service has not been a decisive factor in our discussions, I propose that we choose "USA Star Diner" for our meal. In the third round, we can finalize our decision and select specific dishes to ensure everyone's dietary needs and taste preferences are satisfied. If any member has additional insights or reservations, now would be the time to address them. Otherwise, we can move forward with "USA Star Diner" as our dining destination.

[Henry->all]: Reflecting on the discussion points from Rachel, Ruby, Hugo, and considering my own preferences, "USA Star Diner" seems to be the most suitable option for our dining experience. While "American Flavors" offers traditional and premium dishes that might align with my taste for quality meat dishes, the overall value and flexibility of "USA Star Diner" appear to better cater to the group's diverse needs without compromising on quality or taste.

Rachel's dietary restrictions can be accommodated with dairy-free modifications at "USA Star Diner." Ruby's and Hugo's desire for quality and freshness seems to be met by the diner's menu items, such as the USA Star Salad and the Smokey BBQ Ribs. The lower price point offers the added benefit of good value without suggesting a lower quality of food or service.

Since service quality has not been a major consideration and no negative comments have been noted about either establishment, it makes sense to prioritize the group's dietary preferences and the quality of the food offered.

In the spirit of reaching a consensus and moving towards a final decision in the third round, I support the proposal to dine at "USA Star Diner." The menu offers meat-based dishes that I am sure to enjoy, such as the Smokey BBQ Ribs and the Pulled Pork Sandwich, and the pricing is favorable.

If everyone agrees, we can proceed to the final round to select the specific dishes we wish to order. If there are any final considerations or preferences to discuss, let's address them now to ensure our final choice reflects the best possible dining experience for all of us.

Ruby agreed, emphasizing the importance of fresh ingredients and good value, and proposed the Smokey BBQ Ribs. Hugo was initially inclined towards 'American Flavors' for a gourmet burger experience but found the quality and price of 'USA Star Diner' to be compelling. Henry also supported 'USA Star Diner,' looking forward to the meat-based dishes like the Smokey BBQ Ribs and Pulled Pork Sandwich.

[Rachel->all]: The Classic American Burger was good, particularly for its price point. It wasn't the gourmet experience I've had at higher-end establishments, but for what it was, it was satisfying. The USA Star Salad was fresh and the ingredients tasted of good quality, a solid choice for a healthy option. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were the highlight of the meal for me, with the right balance of smokiness and tenderness. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was also quite enjoyable, though I've had better.

[Rachel->all]: I've reviewed both menus, and considering my gourmet taste, health considerations, and the need for dairy-free options, I suggest we might lean towards USA Star Diner. They seem to have a few more sophisticated options and have a higher customer score, which suggests better service and quality. Plus, I have a previous positive experience there which makes me inclined to revisit. However, I am open to hearing your preferences and thoughts before we make a final decision.

[Ruby->all]: While I appreciate the American cuisine offered by both restaurants, my preference leans towards sushi, which neither establishment specializes in. However, considering the available options, I would lean towards USA Star Diner due to its higher customer score, indicating potentially better service and food quality. They also seem to offer dishes that are more aligned with my discerning palate, such as the Smokey BBQ Ribs and the Star-Spangled Skillet Cornbread. I'm also interested in trying their Liberty Milkshake. Let's continue discussing and see where everyone else's preferences lie.

[Hugo->all]: Given our gourmet tastes and the need for a healthy option, I'm inclined to agree with Rachel and Ruby about heading to USA Star Diner. The menu items such as the Classic American Burger, Smokey BBQ Ribs, and the USA Star Salad seem particularly appealing and suitable for our group's preferences. The customer score is reassuring, and since I am a leader within our group, I believe we should consider quality and service as top priorities, which USA Star Diner appears to deliver based on the feedback. Moreover, the fact that I have been there before and had a positive experience adds to my suggestion of choosing USA Star Diner. I'm eager to hear Henry's input before we come to a joint decision.

[Henry->all]: While I do enjoy the atmosphere and menu at USA Star Diner, the prospect of trying a new spot like American Flavors is also quite appealing. Their special welcome offer for the Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs is competitively priced, and it's always exciting to explore new tastes. However, given that we are looking for a place that offers delicious food, superior service, and at a lower price, and considering my previous satisfactory dining experience at USA Star Diner, it seems to align more with our collective preferences.

The Smokey BBQ Ribs at USA Star Diner have been a highlight in the past, and since I have a taste for meat and no dietary restrictions, it would be a fitting choice for me once again. The service has been efficient and the overall experience positive, which is significant for someone with reserved personality traits who values a reliable and comfortable dining atmosphere.

Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to an agreement on which restaurant would be the best choice for our group. I'm leaning towards USA Star Diner based on our criteria, but I'm open to hearing any further arguments for American Flavors.

[Rachel->all]: Given our collective preferences for gourmet dishes, the importance of service quality, and my dietary restrictions, I believe USA Star Diner remains the superior choice. The higher customer score indicates consistent quality and service. The previous experiences of Hugo and myself at USA Star Diner have been positive, which increases the likelihood of a satisfying meal for the group. Therefore, I propose that we choose USA Star Diner for our dining experience. 

Before we finalize, I'd like to hear if anyone has any specific dish preferences or if there are any concerns about my proposal. If everyone is in agreement, we can move towards the final decision in the next round of our discussion.

[Ruby->all]: Rachel, your proposal to select USA Star Diner aligns with my initial inclination as well. Their menu offers a variety of dishes that cater to our diverse tastes, and the consistent positive feedback suggests we can expect a satisfying dining experience. The Smokey BBQ Ribs and Liberty Milkshake are particularly appealing to me, and I believe they would accommodate my discerning taste.

Given the information we have, I am in favor of choosing USA Star Diner. However, I respect the group's decision and am willing to consider any final points before we make our selection. If there are no further preferences or objections, I suggest we proceed with confirming USA Star Diner as our dining destination in the next round of our discussion. Shall we move forward?

Two rules:

If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Rachel->all]: Based on our previous experiences and the information provided, I'm leaning towards "American Flavors" for our next dining experience. Their customer score is significantly higher at 9.0 compared to 7.35 for "USA Star Diner". While the BBQ Ribs at "USA Star Diner" have been a consistent highlight, "American Flavors" offers a new dish, the Patriot Pulled Pork, which seems intriguing and could potentially meet our gourmet expectations. As someone who is lactose intolerant and prefers dairy-free options, I noticed that "American Flavors" has a Caesar Salad, which could potentially be modified to accommodate my dietary restrictions. Additionally, their Iced Americano would be a lovely dairy-free beverage choice. Given my sophisticated taste, I am always in pursuit of new culinary adventures, and "American Flavors" seems to provide that with their higher customer scores and positive comments. However, I would like to hear everyone else's thoughts and preferences before we make a final decision.

[Ruby->all]: I appreciate your thoughts, Rachel. As someone who has an affinity for sushi, neither restaurant directly caters to my preferred cuisine. However, considering my discerning palate and a healthy lifestyle, I am inclined to agree that "American Flavors" might be a better choice. The higher customer score suggests a superior dining experience, and I'm curious about the Patriot Pulled Pork, which could be a refreshing change from the usual fare we've had. My affluent income allows for flexibility in choice without worrying about the price point too much, as long as the experience justifies the cost.

The comments for "American Flavors" are consistently positive, indicating delicious food and excellent service. While I do enjoy the Smokey BBQ Ribs at "USA Star Diner," I think it might be time to explore the new flavors on offer at "American Flavors." Their menu also seems to have more diverse options that could potentially offer a more refined dining experience. I'd like to hear Hugo's and Henry's preferences as well before we move forward with a decision.

[Hugo->all]: Thank you, Rachel and Ruby, for sharing your insights. As an affluent individual with a taste for gourmet burgers, I am intrigued by the Classic Cheeseburger at "American Flavors." The customer score of 9.0 is impressive, and the positive comments indicate that we are likely to enjoy a meal with delicious food and superior service. My healthy lifestyle aligns well with the available options, and I have no dietary restrictions that would limit my choices.

The description of the Patriot Pulled Pork particularly catches my attention as a new item that I would love to try. I think it's crucial that we continue to explore and not just settle for what we've had before, especially when there is an opportunity for a potentially more satisfying dining experience. Given that the service at "USA Star Diner" was efficient but not exceptional, I'm leaning towards "American Flavors" for its higher score and the allure of trying something new and potentially more delicious.

I'm eager to hear Henry's perspective and see if he shares our inclination towards "American Flavors" or has a different opinion. Once we've all shared our initial thoughts, we can consider a proposal for our next dining destination.

[Henry->all]: As the remaining member of the group to express my initial thoughts, I've carefully considered the options presented by both restaurants. Given my healthy state and lack of dietary restrictions, my focus is primarily on the taste and quality of the meat dishes offered, as well as the overall service and pricing.

While "USA Star Diner" has been a reliable choice with its Smokey BBQ Ribs that I've previously enjoyed, the opportunity to try the new Patriot Pulled Pork at "American Flavors" is quite appealing. Their higher customer score of 9.0 and the positive comments about their service and menu items, such as the Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs, suggest that "American Flavors" might offer a superior dining experience.

Considering my reserved personality, a restaurant with a reputation for excellent service would likely make for a more comfortable and enjoyable meal. Additionally, my affluent income status allows me to prioritize the quality and experience of the meal over the cost, which aligns with the slightly higher-priced options at "American Flavors."

Based on these considerations and the input from Rachel, Ruby, and Hugo, I am also inclined to suggest "American Flavors" as our next dining destination. I believe that trying a new place with positive reviews will maximize our collective utility in terms of delicious food and service quality. I look forward to hearing the group's final thoughts and moving towards a decision in the next round of our discussion.

[Rachel->all]: The dishes we tried at "American Flavors" were mostly impressive. The Classic Cheeseburger was truly outstanding, deserving a perfect score for its flavor and quality. The Caesar Salad was another favorite, with its fresh ingredients and well-balanced dressing; a delightful surprise considering my lactose intolerance. The BBQ Ribs and Buffalo Wings also stood out with great taste and texture, while the Iced Americano provided a refreshing end to the meal. The Patriot Pulled Pork, though good, didn't quite meet the high expectations set by the other dishes. My individual scores would be as follows: Classic Cheeseburger - 10, Caesar Salad - 9.5, BBQ Ribs - 8.7, Buffalo Wings - 9.7, Iced Americano - 7.1, Patriot Pulled Pork - 7.8. Overall, a very satisfying dining experience.

[Ruby->all]: The meal at "American Flavors" was quite enjoyable. The Classic Cheeseburger was exceptional, definitely deserving of a top score. I found the Caesar Salad to be excellently prepared, complementing my healthy lifestyle, and it was a pleasant surprise to find such a high-quality salad in a primarily meat-focused restaurant. The BBQ Ribs and Buffalo Wings were delicious, nearly reaching the pinnacle of what I'd expect from such dishes. The Iced Americano was good, though not the highlight of the meal. The Patriot Pulled Pork was tasty, but not as impressive as the other offerings. My individual scores would reflect this, with the Classic Cheeseburger at a 10, Caesar Salad at 9.5, BBQ Ribs at 8.7, Buffalo Wings at 9.7, Iced Americano at 7.1, and Patriot Pulled Pork at 7.8. Overall, the experience was aligned with my discerning tastes, and I appreciate the quality of the food and service at "American Flavors."

[Hugo->all]: The offerings at "American Flavors" were largely exceptional. The Classic Cheeseburger hit all the right notes for me, easily earning a top score. The Caesar Salad's quality was a delightful match for my health-conscious choices, while the BBQ Ribs and Buffalo Wings were delectable, satisfying my gourmet burger inclination. The Iced Americano was quite satisfactory, a good pairing with the meal. The Patriot Pulled Pork, although good, didn't quite live up to the anticipation generated by its menu description. My individual scores are: Classic Cheeseburger - 10, Caesar Salad - 9.5, BBQ Ribs - 8.7, Buffalo Wings - 9.7, Iced Americano - 7.1, Patriot Pulled Pork - 7.8. The dining experience at "American Flavors" was gratifying, and the service matched the high standard set by the food.

[Henry->all]: The dishes at "American Flavors" were predominantly excellent. The Classic Cheeseburger stood out as the pinnacle of the mealâ€”truly a flawless dish. The Caesar Salad was remarkably tasty and fresh, which was much appreciated. Both the BBQ Ribs and the Buffalo Wings delivered on flavor and were cooked to perfection. The Iced Americano was a decent complement to the meal, although it was not the standout. However, the Patriot Pulled Pork, while good, didn't quite hit the mark when compared to the other dishes. Here are my individual scores: Classic Cheeseburger - 10, Caesar Salad - 9.5, BBQ Ribs - 8.7, Buffalo Wings - 9.7, Iced Americano - 7.1, Patriot Pulled Pork - 7.8. The experience overall was very enjoyable, and the service was impressive, adding to the positive dining experience.

[Rachel->all]: Looking at our dining options, I'm inclined towards "American Flavors" for our next meal. They have a higher customer score, and the comments about their dishes are quite impressive. The Classic Cheeseburger and Caesar Salad have been consistently praised, and I think I would enjoy the Caesar Salad, as long as it's prepared without cheese to accommodate my lactose intolerance. Their advertisement for the American Combo Meal also seems like a great deal. However, I'm open to hearing what the rest of you think.

[Ruby->all]: Given my personal preferences and the information provided, I'd also lean towards "American Flavors." My taste for sushi suggests I enjoy well-crafted dishes, and the high praise for the Classic Cheeseburger and Caesar Salad at "American Flavors" indicates that their food quality is likely to be superior. Furthermore, I am in good health and have no dietary restrictions, so I can freely choose from the menu.

Although "USA Star Diner" has a lower customer score, the Smokey BBQ Ribs have been highlighted as a standout dish, which could be a delicious option. However, since there's no mention of sushi or similar cuisine that aligns with my tastes at either restaurant, I'll base my decision more on the overall quality and customer feedback.

Considering that I am discerning and have an affluent income, the price difference between the two restaurants is less of a concern. Therefore, I'm inclined to prioritize food quality and service, which seem to be better at "American Flavors" based on the customer score and comments.

I would like to hear Hugo's and Henry's preferences before we make a final decision. What are your thoughts on the restaurants and dishes, considering our past dining experiences?

[Hugo->all]: Considering the criteria of paying a lower price, having more delicious food, and superior service, my choice would also be "American Flavors." As someone with a taste for gourmet burgers, the high praise for the Classic Cheeseburger at "American Flavors" is particularly appealing to me. Moreover, as a health-conscious individual, the option to pair the burger with a Caesar Salad for a balanced meal is enticing.

The higher customer score and consistently positive feedback about "American Flavors" suggest that the dining experience will be to my liking, and as a leader, I value the quality and service that seem to be part of "American Flavors'" reputation.

Price is not the primary concern given my affluent income, so I am more inclined to focus on the quality and taste of the food, which "American Flavors" appears to deliver on. While the Smokey BBQ Ribs at "USA Star Diner" were enjoyable in the past, it seems reasonable to opt for a restaurant with a higher overall score and dishes that align more closely with my gourmet burger preference.

Let's hear from Henry before we move towards a final decision. Henry, what are your thoughts?

[Henry->all]: Given the information and the preferences of the group, I would also suggest that we dine at "American Flavors." My taste for meat aligns perfectly with their praised Classic Cheeseburger, and as a healthy individual with no dietary restrictions, I can enjoy most of the menu items. The superior customer score and positive comments about the food and service at "American Flavors" make it an appealing choice for me.

While "USA Star Diner" has the Smokey BBQ Ribs that we all seemed to enjoy previously, the consistently higher scores and the standout dishes at "American Flavors" suggest that we might have a better overall dining experience there. Being reserved, I appreciate good service and a pleasant dining atmosphere, which "American Flavors" seems to provide based on customer feedback.

As an affluent individual, the price is a secondary concern to the quality and taste of the food, which "American Flavors" appears to excel in. I am keen to try their Classic Cheeseburger and see if it lives up to the acclaim it has received.

Let's proceed to the next round of discussion to see if we can reach a consensus or if there are any other considerations we should take into account before making our final decision.

[Rachel->all]: Hello everyone, given our experiences and the information provided, I think we should consider going to American Flavors today. Their overall customer score is significantly higher than USA Star Diner's, and the comments suggest that the quality of food and service is consistently high. I'm particularly drawn to their BBQ Ribs and Buffalo Wings, which have been highly praised. However, I'll need to avoid the Classic Cheeseburger and Caesar Salad due to my lactose intolerance. I'm leaning towards the Patriot Pulled Pork without slaw and perhaps the Sweet Potato Fries, as they sound like gourmet dishes that would fit my sophisticated palate. What do you all think?

[Ruby->all]: Hi Rachel, I agree that American Flavors has garnered higher scores and better feedback, especially for dishes like the BBQ Ribs and Buffalo Wings. As someone with a discerning palate who prefers sushi, I'm inclined to choose a restaurant with high-quality ingredients and a reputation for delicious food. Although there isn't sushi on the menu, I think the creativity shown in American Flavors' dishes like the Patriot Pulled Pork and the introduction of new items like the Sweet Potato Fries and Mississippi Mud Pie could provide a delightful experience. Moreover, being in good health and without dietary restrictions, I'm open to trying a variety of dishes. The American Combo Meal seems like a good deal, and I'm curious to taste their New York Cheesecake. Let's hear from Hugo and Henry before we make a final decision.

[Hugo->all]: Thank you, Rachel and Ruby, for sharing your thoughts. As an affluent individual with a taste for gourmet burgers, health consciousness, and no dietary restrictions, I find the offerings at American Flavors to be more aligned with my preferences. The customer scores and positive comments about their Classic Cheeseburger, which falls directly into my gourmet preference, are particularly appealing. Additionally, their menu seems to offer a higher quality of delicious food, which is essential to me.

I would be inclined to suggest we choose American Flavors for our meal. I'm intrigued by their Classic Cheeseburger and would like to try the BBQ Ribs as both dishes have been consistently praised. Given my healthy lifestyle, the Caesar Salad could be a good choice, but I'm also tempted by the newly introduced Sweet Potato Fries. For service, American Flavors seems to have the edge over USA Star Diner, and superior service is something I value highly.

Let's wait to hear Henry's input before we come to a conclusion.

[Henry->all]: While both restaurants have their merits, I'm inclined to agree with the previous suggestions and lean towards American Flavors. The higher customer score and consistent positive feedback make it a compelling choice. The menu at American Flavors seems to have a good variety of meat dishes, which suits my preference for meat. I'm particularly interested in trying the BBQ Ribs, as they have received high praise across the board.

Given my affluent income, I'm not particularly constrained by the price, although I always appreciate good value for money. The American Combo Meal could be a good choice, but I'd like to order the BBQ Ribs as a standalone dish to fully enjoy them. The Buffalo Wings also caught my attention as a delicious option.

Healthwise, I am in good health and have no dietary restrictions, so the full range of the menu is available to me. My reserved personality leans towards a quieter dining experience with superior service, which seems to be one of American Flavors' strengths.

I would like to hear any final thoughts before we proceed to the next round of discussion and aim towards a decision.

[Rachel->all]: Based on our discussions, it seems we're all in agreement that American Flavors would be the preferable choice for our dining experience today. The higher customer scores and the consistent praise in the comments suggest that we can expect superior service and delicious food that aligns with our gourmet tastes. While I have to be mindful of my lactose intolerance, there are plenty of options on the menu that cater to my dietary restrictions, such as the Patriot Pulled Pork and Sweet Potato Fries. I'm glad to see that the dishes I'm interested in also appeal to the rest of the group. If everyone is on board, I propose that we choose American Flavors for our meal today and begin considering which dishes to order to ensure a variety that satisfies all our tastes and preferences. Shall we move to the next round and start selecting our dishes?

[Ruby->all]: It looks like we're all leaning towards American Flavors. Given the high scores for both food and service and the positive comments, I'm excited about dining there. Considering everyone's tastes and the fact that we don't have any dietary restrictions to worry about, we have a wide selection of dishes to choose from.

For our meal, I propose we order the American Combo Meal for its variety and value; the BBQ Ribs, which have been highly recommended; the Buffalo Wings for a spicy option; and the New York Cheesecake and Mississippi Mud Pie for dessert. This should give us a good mix of what American Flavors has to offer. Of course, I'm open to suggestions if anyone wants to add or replace any dishes based on their preferences. Shall we finalize our choices and enjoy what promises to be a delicious meal?

[Hugo->all]: I'm glad to see that we're all in agreement about choosing American Flavors, and I appreciate the proposed selections. The American Combo Meal offers a great way to experience a range of flavors, including the Classic Cheeseburger that I'm particularly keen on trying. The BBQ Ribs are a must-have given their consistent praise, and the Buffalo Wings will add a nice variety to our meal.

As for the desserts, the New York Cheesecake and Mississippi Mud Pie both sound indulgent, and I'm looking forward to trying them. I would like to add the Sweet Potato Fries to our order as they represent the kind of creative side dish that I enjoy, and they've been highlighted as a new addition to the menu.

If there are no objections or further suggestions, I think we have a solid meal plan that caters to our diverse tastes while ensuring we all get to try the dishes we're most excited about. Let's move forward with selecting these dishes for our meal at American Flavors.

I'd rate it a 9.5. The BBQ Ribs were good, not the best I've ever had but still quite enjoyable, so an 8.7 seems fair. The Buffalo Wings were surprisingly the star of the evening for me, absolutely delicious, a solid 9.7. The New York Cheesecake, despite my lactose intolerance, I took a small bite just to try, and it was creamy and perfect, a 9 from me. The Mississippi Mud Pie was very good, an 8.1, and the Sweet Potato Fries were good but nothing too special, so a 7.1 for those. Overall, an amazing dining experience at American Flavors!

[Ruby->all]: The American Combo Meal was a delightful surprise with its variety and quality, definitely deserving a 9.4 from me. The BBQ Ribs were tender and flavorful, getting an 8.7. The Buffalo Wings were the highlight with their perfect balance of spice and flavor, a 9.7 for sure. The New York Cheesecake was rich and hit the spot, earning a 9.0, while the Mississippi Mud Pie, with its deep chocolate flavor, was very satisfying, an 8.1. The Sweet Potato Fries were a decent side, and I'd give them a 7.1. American Flavors provided an excellent meal that was both memorable and enjoyable.

[Hugo->all]: The meal we had at American Flavors was truly a gourmet experience. The American Combo Meal was exceptional, easily a 9.4; the variety and quality were top-notch. The BBQ Ribs, while not the best I've ever had, were still quite delectable, warranting an 8.7. The Buffalo Wings were a revelation, perfectly cooked with just the right amount of heat; they get a 9.7 from me. The New York Cheesecake was sublime, creamy and just dense enough to satisfy, a 9.0. The Mississippi Mud Pie was deeply chocolaty and rich, scoring an 8.1. Lastly, the Sweet Potato Fries were good, though not particularly extraordinary, so I'll give them a 7.1. Overall, American Flavors delivered an exquisite dining experience that catered to my tastes for gourmet food and high-quality service.

[Henry->all]: The American Combo Meal was truly exceptional, and I'd give it a 9.4 for its impressive variety and taste. The BBQ Ribs had a beautiful smoky flavor that I quite enjoyed, so they get an 8.7 from me. The Buffalo Wings were the best I've ever had, spicy and cooked to perfection, deserving a score of 9.7. The New York Cheesecake was creamy and just the right amount of sweet, a solid 9.0. The Mississippi Mud Pie was indulgent and satisfying, meriting an 8.1. The Sweet Potato Fries, while not the standout of the meal, were still quite tasty and get a 7.1 from me. American Flavors exceeded my expectations, and I'm very pleased with our choice to dine here.

[Rachel->all]: Good evening everyone, considering our past experiences and the new information provided, I suggest we discuss which restaurant we'd like to visit tonight. I'm leaning towards American Flavors given their higher customer score and our previous positive experiences there. However, I must admit USA Star Diner's new menu items do sound tempting. As someone who appreciates gourmet dishes and requires dairy-free options due to my lactose intolerance, I have to be particular about my choices. What are your thoughts?

[Ruby->all]: Hello everyone, I've been going over our experiences and the menus, and I'm inclined to agree with Rachel about leaning towards American Flavors. As someone who is affluent and has a discerning taste, particularly for sushi, I don't see many options that cater to my preference at either restaurant. However, based on the customer scores and our previous positive experiences, American Flavors seems to have an edge in terms of delicious food and service. USA Star Diner's Adventurous Avocado Veggie Burger does catch my eye as a novel option, but it doesn't align with my sushi preference. I'm healthy with no dietary restrictions, so I'm flexible with the menu, but I do prioritize a superior dining experience. Let's hear what Hugo and Henry have to say before making a final decision.

[Hugo->all]: Hello Rachel and Ruby, I appreciate both of your insights. Given my income level and gourmet burger taste, I am naturally drawn to American Flavors, especially since they offer a Classic Cheeseburger that has received excellent reviews from us previously. In terms of health, I have no dietary restrictions to worry about, but I do prefer healthier options that don't compromise on taste. The Vegan Power Bowl at American Flavors could be a good choice to balance both health and flavor. As a leader, I'd like us to consider the best overall experience which, based on our past visits, seems to be at American Flavors. They also have a higher customer score, which is an indicator of superior service and food quality, aligning with our criteria. I'm curious to hear Henry's take on this before we make a final decision.

[Henry->all]: Good evening, folks. I've been following the discussion and agree with the points made about American Flavors. Given my personal preference for meat, their menu options such as the BBQ Ribs and Classic Cheeseburger are particularly appealing to me. My affluent status affords me the luxury of not being too concerned about the price, but I do appreciate a good deal. The superior service and consistently higher scores for American Flavors suggest a better dining experience overall, which suits my reserved personality as I prefer places where I know what to expect and can enjoy my meal in peace. Although USA Star Diner has introduced some new items, I haven't seen enough evidence to convince me that their offerings would be more delicious than what we've enjoyed at American Flavors. I look forward to hearing any further thoughts before we reach a consensus.

[Rachel->all]: I appreciate everyone's input and I'm glad to see a general consensus forming around American Flavors. Considering the high customer scores and our previous positive experiences, it seems to offer the best match for our collective preferences. I would like to propose that we choose American Flavors for tonight's dinner. We can accommodate my lactose intolerance by avoiding dairy-laden dishes, and there appears to be a variety of options that cater to our different tastes, including gourmet dishes like the BBQ Ribs and healthier choices such as the Vegan Power Bowl. If everyone is in agreement, then we can move forward with this decision in the next round. What do you all think?

[Ruby->all]: Rachel, your proposal to head to American Flavors sounds like a plan I can get behind. The consistently high scores and our prior satisfaction with their dishes make a compelling case. While none of the restaurants specialize in sushi, American Flavors has demonstrated a capacity for quality and service that I value as a discerning customer. Plus, their menu variety should be able to offer something enjoyable for each of us. Hugo, Henry, if you're both in agreement, I think we're ready to finalize our choice and select our dishes. Shall we?

The Vegan Power Bowl, while not my usual choice, was surprisingly tasty. The American Deluxe Combo offered a good variety, and the New York Cheesecake was a delightful end to the meal. I'd give the Buffalo Wings a 10 for their perfection, the BBQ Ribs and Cheesecake a 9 for their high quality, and an 8 for the Classic Cheeseburger, Vegan Power Bowl, and American Deluxe Combo for their overall goodness.

[Rachel->all]: Hello everyone, I've been looking through our options and considering our past experiences, I'm leaning towards American Flavors. Not only does it have a higher customer score, but our individual experiences there have been consistently great. The menu at American Flavors also seems to have a variety of dishes that can accommodate my lactose intolerance and preference for gourmet dishes. I noticed there's a Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish that could be delightful. The New York Cheesecake, however, would be off-limits for me due to my dietary restrictions. What do you all think?

[Ruby]: I agree with Rachel about American Flavors, the dishes there have been impressive, and I enjoyed the diversity of their menu. The Caesar Salad and the American Deluxe Combo were my favorites. If we are looking for delicious food and superior service, I think American Flavors is the right choice.

[Hugo]: I'm inclined to agree as well. While I appreciate the new health-conscious options at USA Star Diner, the overall experience at American Flavors has been superior. The BBQ Ribs and Buffalo Wings were particularly good, and the service has been excellent every time we've gone.

[Henry]: American Flavors has indeed been excellent, and their menu options like the Vegan Power Bowl cater well to a variety of dietary needs. I've enjoyed every meal there, and I think it's the better choice for our gourmet taste and Rachel's dietary restrictions.

[Rachel]: It seems we're all in agreement then. Shall we finalize our decision and choose American Flavors for our next dining experience? If so, I would like to propose a selection of dishes that cater to all of our tastes and requirements. How does that sound?

[Ruby]: Sounds good to me, Rachel. Let's make a selection that includes options for everyone.

[Hugo]: I'm on board with that. Let's pick a range of dishes from American Flavors.

[Henry]: Agreed. I'm looking forward to another excellent meal at American Flavors. Let's choose the dishes.

[Rachel]: Great, I'll put together a proposal for our meal in the next round of our discussion.

[Ruby->all]: I'm delighted we're all considering American Flavors! Given my taste for sushi, while it may not be directly on the menu, I appreciate the fresh ingredients and meticulous preparation that a dish like the Vegan Power Bowl suggests. It aligns with my preference for high-quality, carefully crafted food. I'm healthy and have no dietary restrictions, so I'm quite open to trying various dishes. However, considering my discerning nature, I would suggest we opt for dishes that have been consistently praised in our previous experiences as well as by other customers. I would lean towards the Buffalo Wings, American Deluxe Combo for that indulgent American taste, and the Caesar Salad for something lighter. To accommodate Rachel's lactose intolerance, we should consider the Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish. I'm looking forward to our final selection and a wonderful dining experience! What would everyone else like to have?

[Hugo->all]: I'm glad we're mostly in consensus about American Flavors. Given my affluent income, I don't mind paying a bit more for superior quality in both food and service, which American Flavors has consistently provided. I have a penchant for gourmet burgers, so I'd definitely like to include the Classic Cheeseburger in our order. My health-conscious side appreciates their healthier options, so the Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish should be on our list as well. This way, we can enjoy a balance of indulgence and health. I don't have any dietary restrictions, so I'm open to trying a variety of dishes. The American Deluxe Combo seems like a great choice to get a taste of everything. Given my personality as a leader, I propose we make a decision that covers the breadth of the menu to satisfy all palates and dietary needs. Let's make sure we include the dishes that everyone has enjoyed in the past, and maybe try the new American Heritage Sandwich as it's part of their latest offerings. What do you all think?

[Henry->all]: Given my reserved nature, I won't be too vocal, but I'd like to point out that I tend to prefer meat dishes and have an affluent income, so the price is not the primary concern for me. My health is in good condition, and I have no dietary restrictions. Based on our previous experiences, American Flavors seems to have provided us with both delicious food and superior service, which are the key criteria for our decision.

I've enjoyed the dishes at American Flavors, particularly the BBQ Ribs and the Buffalo Wings, which align with my taste for meat dishes. Since I am reserved, I support the group's positive inclination towards American Flavors. I would suggest that we also consider ordering the Classic Cheeseburger, as it has been a highlight in our past dining experiences.

For the next round, I would recommend that we finalize our decision with a range of dishes that reflect our various tastes and preferences, ensuring that we all have a satisfying meal. I'm looking forward to hearing the proposed selection from Rachel and making our final decision in the third round of our discussion.

[Hugo]: The Classic Cheeseburger was a gourmet delight and met my expectations for quality. The Vegan Power Bowl was a pleasant surprise, offering a healthier yet flavorful option.

The Caesar Salad was a good addition, though not the most exciting part of the meal. Both the Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish offered delicious alternatives that align with healthier choices. The American Deluxe Combo provided a great sampling of the restaurant's offerings, and the American Heritage Sandwich was a decent new option, although it didn't particularly stand out.

[Rachel->all]: Considering our previous experiences, American Flavors seems to consistently meet our gourmet expectations and they offer a diverse menu that caters to my dairy-free dietary needs. Their Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish are particularly appealing options for me. The customer scores are also higher in comparison to USA Star Diner.

[Ruby]: I agree with Rachel on the quality of American Flavors. Their Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs were delicious. However, I also noticed USA Star Diner has some new items that we haven't tried yet like the 'Diners' Delight Combo'. Maybe it's worth considering for variety's sake?

[Hugo]: American Flavors does have superior service and a better menu for our tastes, but I'm also intrigued by the new offerings at USA Star Diner. It might be useful to compare prices and see if the new items are worth the switch, given our past experiences.

[Henry]: I've enjoyed the meals at American Flavors, especially the consistency in their quality dishes. However, I do think the 'Vegan Delight Burger' at USA Star Diner could be a good dairy-free option for Rachel. Let's also consider the cost-effectiveness of our choice since Rachel has an affluent income and we all appreciate gourmet dishes. 

[Rachel]: I appreciate your consideration of my dietary restrictions. While USA Star Diner does have some interesting options, I must say that American Flavors has already proven to satisfy my gourmet taste and dairy-free needs. They also have a loyalty program that could offer us additional benefits. Shall we give American Flavors another try and maybe include some of the new dishes in our order this time?

[Ruby]: I am leaning towards American Flavors as well due to their higher scores and positive comments. Rachel, if you're suggesting we try new dishes there, I think that's a great idea. It gives us familiarity and variety.

[Hugo]: I'm on board with sticking to American Flavors. The loyalty program benefits sound promising, and their menu has been consistently impressive. Let's go for some new dishes along with our favorites.

[Henry]: It seems we're leaning towards American Flavors. I'm good with this decision. Exploring new dishes there could refresh our experience while ensuring we enjoy a high-quality meal.

[Rachel]: It looks like we have a general consensus on returning to American Flavors. I propose that we order a mix of our known favorites and some new items, emphasizing dairy-free options for myself. If everyone agrees, we can finalize this in the next round.

[Ruby->all]: I appreciate everyone's input. I'm inclined to choose American Flavors too, considering the consistency in quality and service we've experienced. My personal preference for sushi isn't on the menu, but the diverse offerings, including the American Deluxe Combo and New York Cheesecake, have been delightful. Given my affluent income, I'm willing to pay for a high-quality meal that provides both delicious food and excellent service. Let's finalize our decision to dine at American Flavors and include some new dishes to keep our dining experience exciting. Does everyone agree?

[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant. If you don't make choices, return 'None'>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.

[Rachel->all]: After reviewing the experiences and menus from both "USA Star Diner" and "American Flavors," I am inclined to suggest that we dine at "American Flavors." The customer scores are consistently higher, and it seems they offer a more sophisticated and gourmet dining experience, which aligns with my personal taste. Moreover, they have a Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Fish, which are excellent dairy-free options for my lactose intolerance. What do you all think?

[Ruby->all]: Well, based on our previous experiences and the information provided, my vote would also go to American Flavors. As an affluent individual with a discerning palate that favors sushi, I'm always looking for a restaurant that offers high-quality, delicious food, which seems to be the case with American Flavors based on the scores and comments. While sushi isn't on the menu, the quality of the dishes seems to align with my taste for fine dining. Additionally, the service has been noted as excellent, which is important to me. I have no dietary restrictions, so I am flexible with the menu choices. I am curious, however, to hear Hugo's and Henry's opinions before we make a final decision.

[Hugo->all]: I appreciate the insights from both Rachel and Ruby. Given my affinity for gourmet burgers and the importance I place on high-quality service, I'm also leaning towards "American Flavors." The customer scores are impressive, and the comments highlight the consistency and quality of the food, particularly the Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs, which are right up my alley. My health-conscious mindset is satisfied with the inclusion of dishes like the Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, offering a balance to indulge sensibly. My leadership personality drives me to seek the best for our group, and "American Flavors" seems to stand out in this regard. Let's see what Henry has to say, but I'm prepared to endorse "American Flavors" as our dining choice. Henry, your thoughts?

[Henry->all]: Given my affluent income, taste for meat, healthy condition, lack of dietary restrictions, and reserved personality, I agree with the consensus leaning towards "American Flavors." My previous experiences there have been consistently positive, with high individual scores reflecting my satisfaction with the dishes, particularly the meat-centric options like the Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs. The superior service at "American Flavors" aligns with my preference for a more refined dining environment where I can enjoy my meal without unnecessary interaction, catering to my reserved nature. The pricing, while potentially higher than "USA Star Diner," is within my financial means and seems justified by the quality of the food and service provided. I'm ready to proceed with "American Flavors" as our choice unless there are any further considerations or dissenting opinions from the group. Shall we move to the next round to finalize our decision?

    "summary": "After a thorough discussion, the group has unanimously decided to dine at American Flavors. The decision was influenced by the restaurant's high customer scores and consistent quality of food and service, as reported in previous experiences. Rachel's preference for gourmet dishes and dairy-free options was met by the Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Fish. Ruby, while having no dietary restrictions, expressed a desire for high-quality food, which aligns with American Flavors' reputation. Hugo's gourmet burger preference and health-conscious approach were catered to with the menu choices available, and Henry's taste for meaty dishes and his reserved personality were well-suited to the restaurant's offerings. The group's affluent income allows for the slightly higher prices at American Flavors, justifying the superior quality and service expected. The chosen dishes represent a mix of everyone's preferences, ensuring a delightful dining experience for the entire group."

[Rachel->all]: Considering our past experiences, my preference leans towards American Flavors. Their menu offers a Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Fish, which are great dairy-free options for me. The overall customer score is higher than USA Star Diner's, and our group has consistently enjoyed meals there, especially the American Deluxe Combo and the New York Cheesecake. Although I must avoid the latter due to my lactose intolerance, the rest of the group seems to appreciate it. Given my sophisticated palate and preference for gourmet dishes, American Flavors seems to provide the quality I'm looking for. What do you all think?

[Ruby->all]: While I also have a preference for high-quality meals, and American Flavors consistently provided us with an exceptional dining experience, I must admit my taste leans more towards sushi, which neither restaurant appears to offer. However, given the options available, American Flavors has impressed me with their consistently high scores from our group and the variety in their menu. I value delicious food and superior service, which seems to be a hallmark of American Flavors. Despite this, I'm open to hearing Hugo's and Henry's thoughts before making a final decision. Hugo, Henry, what are your thoughts on where we should dine?

[Hugo->all]: I've been very satisfied with our dining experiences at American Flavors, particularly enjoying the gourmet burgers that align with my taste preferences. The Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs have been consistently praised, and as someone who values delicious food and superior service, I find that American Flavors has met our expectations time and again. Given my affluent income, I'm not particularly constrained by the price, although I do appreciate getting value for money, which American Flavors seems to provide.

My health-conscious side appreciates the healthier options like the Vegan Power Bowl, even though I don't have dietary restrictions myself. I also like to lead by example, and choosing a restaurant that caters to various needs seems like a considerate decision for the group. Based on our past experiences, the higher customer score, and the fact that the menu caters to my gourmet burger preference, I'm inclined to choose American Flavors once again. However, I'm open to hearing Henry's perspective before we make a final decision. Henry, what are your thoughts?

[Henry->all]: As someone who enjoys meat and has no dietary restrictions, I appreciate the options available at American Flavors, especially their Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs, which I have consistently scored highly in the past. Given my healthy status, I don't need to prioritize dietary-specific meals, allowing me to enjoy a wider range of dishes. Considering my reserved personality, I prefer sticking with a restaurant where I know what to expect in terms of food quality and service, which American Flavors has provided during our previous visits.

Moreover, my affluent income allows me to prioritize the quality of the food and the dining experience over the cost, which supports the decision to dine at American Flavors, a restaurant that has delivered both delicious food and excellent service. The consistently high individual scores and positive comments from our group suggest that American Flavors will maximize our utility based on the criteria we've established.

Based on the information provided and my personal preferences, I believe American Flavors is the better choice for our meal. I suggest we continue to enjoy the dishes that have proven to be favorites among our group, such as the Classic Cheeseburger, BBQ Ribs, and for a healthier option, the Vegan Power Bowl to accommodate those with dietary considerations. Shall we proceed with a final decision or are there any other considerations from the group?

[Rachel->all]: The dishes at American Flavors were quite satisfying. I particularly enjoyed the Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, which both catered well to my dairy-free diet. They were good, but not exceptional. The Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs, although I didn't try them, appeared to be a hit with the others. Overall, Iâ€™d rate the meal an 8.7 out of 10 for meeting my dietary needs and providing a gourmet experience.

[Ruby->all]: The meal at American Flavors once again met our high expectations. The Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs lived up to their reputation with their delicious flavors, and the American Deluxe Combo was a delightful assortment that showcased the restaurant's best. The Vegan Power Bowl was a pleasant surprise, being both healthy and tasty, while the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was a good alternative for those with dietary restrictions. Overall, I'd rate our meal an 8.8 out of 10 for its quality and variety, which catered to our discerning tastes.

[Hugo->all]: The dining experience at American Flavors was excellent. The Classic Cheeseburger and the BBQ Ribs maintained their high standard, and I found them particularly delectable. The American Deluxe Combo offered a great taste of what the restaurant does best. I appreciated the Vegan Power Bowl for its healthiness, and it was quite flavorful for a dish with such nutritional value. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was a good option for variety, though not as impressive as the other dishes. I'd give the meal an overall score of 8.5 out of 10, with the standout items being the gourmet burgers and ribs.

[Henry->all]: The American Flavors restaurant provided a meal that was overall quite enjoyable. The standout dishes for me were the Classic Cheeseburger and the BBQ Ribs, both of which were rich in flavor and well-prepared. The American Deluxe Combo offered a satisfying variety and was a great way to sample multiple items. The Vegan Power Bowl, while not my usual choice, was surprisingly good and complemented the other heavier dishes with its freshness. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was decent, though not the highlight of the meal. I would rate the entire dining experience an 8.6 out of 10, recognizing the consistency in delivering high-quality and tasty dishes that align with my preference for meat-centric meals.

[Rachel->all]: Hey everyone, looking at our options, I'm leaning towards American Flavors again. The food has been consistently good, and they have dishes that cater to our diverse tastes and dietary needs. The Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Fish are great for Rachel's dairy-free requirements, and I've been really enjoying the BBQ Ribs. What do you all think?

[Ruby]: I agree with Hugo. American Flavors has been impressive so far, especially with their service. I think it fits Rachel's sophisticated tastes and health needs well. Plus, the loyalty program perks are a nice touch for us as repeat customers. I'm all for going back there.

[Henry]: I'm on board with going to American Flavors too. The quality of the food has been excellent, and it's clear from Rachel's previous scores that she's enjoyed the meals there. The Vegan Power Bowl and the New York Cheesecake are my favorites. Rachel, does this work for you considering your dietary restrictions?

[Rachel]: I appreciate the consideration, everyone. Given my lactose intolerance and preference for dairy-free gourmet dishes, American Flavors seems like the better choice. Their Vegan Power Bowl has been a good option for me, and I've been able to enjoy the high-quality dishes without worrying about my dietary restrictions. Plus, the service has been superior, which adds to the overall dining experience for a sophisticated evening out. Shall we settle on American Flavors then? If we all agree, I'll put together our final order in the next round.

[Ruby->all]: Yes, I think we're in agreement about choosing American Flavors. The menu suits my sushi-loving palate less, as there are no fish dishes aside from the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish. However, considering the overall quality of the food, the excellent service we've experienced, and no dietary restrictions to worry about, it's a good choice for me. Also, I'm curious to try the New York Cheesecake that has been mentioned favorably in several comments. The consistent high scores from our previous visits make me confident that I'll enjoy the meal. If everyone is fine with this, I'll be ready to propose our final order in the following round.

[Hugo->all]: I'm glad we're all leaning towards American Flavors. As someone who appreciates gourmet burgers, I'm particularly drawn to their Classic Cheeseburger and Spicy Southwest Burger. The high customer scores and positive comments about the food and service reinforce my preference. I don't have any dietary restrictions, so I can enjoy the full range of their menu. Given my leadership personality, I propose that we make a decision in the next round to dine at American Flavors, where I believe we'll all find something to our liking. If we're all in agreement, I'll summarize our decision in the final round.

[Henry->all]: We seem to have a consensus on American Flavors. I'm particularly impressed with the consistent quality of the dishes and the service there. As someone with a taste for meat, their BBQ Ribs and Classic Cheeseburger are especially appealing to me. With no dietary restrictions and a preference for a more reserved dining atmosphere, American Flavors suits me well. Plus, the high individual scores from previous experiences show that we've all been quite satisfied with our meals there. If everyone is ready, I can put together our final order in the next round.

[Rachel->all]: The BBQ Ribs were delicious as always, a solid 8.4 for me. The Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Fish were both good; I appreciate how they cater to my dietary restrictions. I'd give them a 7.3. Not having the Cheesecake myself, but judging by the reactions, it seems to deserve an 8.2.

[Ruby->all]: The BBQ Ribs lived up to my expectations with a rich, smoky flavor. I would rate them a good 8.4.

[Hugo->all]: The BBQ Ribs were indeed delicious, perfectly cooked, and the sauce was spot on. I'd rate them an 8.4. The Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Fish were both more than satisfactory, considering they cater to specific dietary needs, so they get a 7.3 from me. The New York Cheesecake was creamy and just the right level of sweet - it gets an 8.2. American Flavors continues to impress with its quality and service.

[Henry->all]: The BBQ Ribs were fantastic, definitely an 8.4. The Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish were good, though not exceptional, so I'll rate them both 7.3. The New York Cheesecake was very enjoyable, earning an 8.2 from me. Happy with the choices we made at American Flavors.

[Rachel->all]: Given my affluent income, gourmet tastes, lactose intolerance, sophisticated personality, and the need for dairy-free options, I'm inclined towards American Flavors based on my previous experiences and the options available that cater to my dietary restrictions. While I appreciate lower prices, the quality of food and service are more important to me. American Flavors has consistently provided high-quality dining experiences with options like the Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Fish that are suitable for my dietary needs. The new spicy herb option for the Vegan Power Bowl sounds particularly appealing. Additionally, the customer score is higher for American Flavors, suggesting better overall satisfaction.

Ruby, Hugo, Henry, what are your thoughts? Shall we consider the comments and the loyalty benefits at American Flavors, or do you have a different preference?

[Ruby->all]: I must say, I'm leaning towards American Flavors as well. My preference for sushi isn't catered to by either restaurant, but the high-quality, diverse menu at American Flavors seems to be the closest match to my discerning tastes. The consistently high scores and positive comments about their dishes, particularly the New York Cheesecake and the BBQ Ribs, make a compelling case. While I have no dietary restrictions and I'm in good health, the quality of food and service are paramount for me, and it seems American Flavors excels in these areas. Their loyalty program is also an attractive perk considering my affluent status. I'm open to hearing what Hugo and Henry think, but American Flavors seems to be a strong contender for our meal.

[Hugo->all]: Well, as a leader and someone with an affluent income who appreciates gourmet burgers, I'm also in favor of American Flavors. The Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs have been consistently praised, and these are right up my alley in terms of taste. The high customer score and my previous positive experiences there make it a clear choice for me. I value delicious food and superior service, both of which American Flavors has been noted for. I don't have any dietary restrictions, and I'm healthy, so I don't need to be concerned with those aspects of the menu. I'm curious to hear Henry's opinion, but I am ready to propose that we choose American Flavors for our meal. Let's discuss and come to a decision that maximizes our group's utility based on our criteria. Henry, what are your preferences?

[Henry->all]: As someone with an affluent income and a taste for meat, I'm drawn to the high-quality dishes at American Flavors, especially the Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs, which have been consistently highlighted in both the menu and customer comments as standout options. I'm in good health with no dietary restrictions, so I'm free to enjoy these offerings. Additionally, I'm quite reserved, and the superior service mentioned at American Flavors appeals to me because it suggests that I can enjoy my meal in a comfortable setting without any unwelcome fuss. 

Considering the overall higher customer satisfaction score and the consistent quality mentioned in the reviews, I am inclined to agree with Rachel, Ruby, and Hugo that American Flavors would be the best choice for our dining experience. The loyalty program benefits are an added bonus that complements my affluent status. Therefore, I support the proposal to dine at American Flavors. Shall we proceed to make this our final decision in the next round?

[Rachel->all]: The Classic Cheeseburger was quite delightful, though not the best I've had, so I'd give it an 8.5. The BBQ Ribs were tender and flavorful, a solid 8.4. The Vegan Power Bowl was a good dairy-free option for me, so I'll rate it a 7.3. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was surprisingly tasty for a gluten-free dish, deserving a 7.3 as well. Finally, the New York Cheesecake was nice, but as someone who is lactose intolerant, I could only have a small bite - it seemed to be a 7.8 from that sample. Overall, the dishes were good, and the service was commendable.

[Ruby->all]: The Classic Cheeseburger was very satisfying, living up to its reputation with a score of 8.5 from me. The BBQ Ribs were also delicious, though I've experienced better, so an 8.4 seems fair. The Vegan Power Bowl didn't necessarily align with my sushi preference, but it was a well-constructed dish, earning a 7.3. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was enjoyable, also a 7.3. Lastly, the New York Cheesecake was delightful, and even without a strong preference for desserts, it gets a 7.8. The overall dining experience was good, with each dish meeting my expectations for quality and service.

[Hugo->all]: The Classic Cheeseburger was really impressive and hit the spot for me; it gets a solid 8.5. The BBQ Ribs were just as good as I'd hoped, maybe even a little better, so they earn an 8.4. I didn't try the Vegan Power Bowl, but it looked well-prepared, so based on appearance and the reactions from others, I'd say a 7.3 is fair. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed it quite a bit, so a 7.3 for that as well. And the New York Cheesecake was a great finish to the meal, deserving a 7.8. Overall, I'm satisfied with both the taste and the service we received.

[Henry->all]: The Classic Cheeseburger was a standout with its smoky sauce and juicy patty, deserving an 8.5. The BBQ Ribs were very good, tender and well-seasoned, so I'm giving them an 8.4. The Vegan Power Bowl, while not my usual choice, was flavorful and fulfilling, so it gets a 7.3. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was also quite good for a gluten-free option, earning a 7.3. The New York Cheesecake was creamy and had a nice berry compote, so it gets a 7.8. The service was excellent, complementing the high-quality dishes. Overall, a very satisfying dining experience.

[Rachel->all]: Everyone seems to be pretty much on the same page with our scores, and we've all enjoyed the dishes to a similar degree. It seems we're consistently rating the Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs as the top dishes, with the Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish also scoring well. The New York Cheesecake was a hit, even if I could only try a little. It sounds like we're all generally satisfied with the meal and service. Shall we tally up our scores and finalize our group review?

[Ruby->all]: I agree with the consensus on the dishes. The Classic Cheeseburger was excellent; I'd give it an 8.5. The BBQ Ribs were succulent and perfectly cooked, deserving an 8.4 from me. The Vegan Power Bowl was a nice surprise in terms of flavor and texture, so I'd rate it a 7.3. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was enjoyable and a solid option for those with dietary restrictions, so it gets a 7.3. The New York Cheesecake was delectable, a perfect balance of sweet and tart, earning a 7.8. The service was attentive and the atmosphere was pleasant, making the overall experience quite enjoyable. I believe we should move forward with summarizing our final review now.

[Rachel->all]: Hello everyone, after reviewing both American Flavors and USA Star Diner, I'm leaning towards American Flavors for our meal. As an affluent customer with gourmet tastes, I appreciate the consistently high scores and positive comments about the dishes at American Flavors, particularly the BBQ Ribs and the Vegan Power Bowl which suits my dairy-free diet. The New York Cheesecake sounds tempting, but I'll have to pass due to my lactose intolerance. The superior service noted by other customers also appeals to my sophisticated preferences. What are all of your thoughts?

[Ruby->all]: I agree with Rachel's suggestion of choosing American Flavors. Given my preference for sushi, I'm always looking for places that offer dishes with finesse and attention to detail, and it seems American Flavors has a reputation for high-quality, well-presented food. The Classic Cheeseburger and the American Deluxe Combo have received consistent praise, and I'm curious to see if their culinary skills can match my discerning taste. Although there's no sushi on the menu, the Vegan Power Bowl seems like a healthy and flavorful alternative. Plus, the service has been consistently rated highly, which is important to me. Let's hear what Hugo and Henry have to say before we make a final decision.

Their menu also aligns with my focus on health, offering options like the Vegan Power Bowl. I have no dietary restrictions, so I'm open to a variety of dishes. American Flavors seems like the preferable choice for me. Let's see what Henry has to say before we decide.

[Henry->all]: I'm inclined to agree with the consensus on American Flavors. As a customer with an affluent income, I have the liberty to prioritize the quality and taste of the food over price concerns, and it seems American Flavors excels in this area, especially with the meat dishes like the BBQ Ribs and Classic Cheeseburger, which suit my meat-centric diet. Additionally, I value a reserved dining atmosphere with superior service, which has been positively highlighted in other customers' experiences at American Flavors. The consistency in the quality of their food across multiple reviews is reassuring for me. I'm ready to move forward with American Flavors unless anyone has any objections or further points to discuss.

[Rachel->all]: Hello everyone! Considering our previous experiences and my personal preferences, including my lactose intolerance, I would lean towards American Flavors again. They have consistently provided us with high-quality dining experiences, and their Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Fish are great dairy-free options for me. Plus, the high customer score suggests we all tend to enjoy our meals there. What do you all think?

[Ruby->all]: Hi Rachel and everyone! I appreciate your thoughts. From my perspective, I have a particular fondness for sushi, which neither restaurant seems to offer. However, considering the available options, American Flavors has a higher customer score and seems to have a wider variety of dishes that we've consistently rated well, such as the Classic Cheeseburger and the BBQ Ribs. While I'm affluent and could afford either option, I believe American Flavors aligns more closely with my discerning palate, given its higher scores and positive comments on the delicious food and superior service. Plus, there are no dietary restrictions that I need to worry about. Let's hear from Hugo and Henry before we make a final decision.

[Hugo->all]: Hey team, Hugo here! I've been listening to your preferences, and I agree that American Flavors seems to be the right choice for us once more. Given our affluent income levels, the focus should be on maximizing the quality and enjoyment of our meal rather than the cost. The Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs at American Flavors have been standout dishes for me personally, fitting perfectly with my gourmet burger taste. Their high customer score reassures us of both delicious food and superior service. Iâ€™m healthy with no dietary restrictions, so I can choose freely from the menu. As a leader, I'm inclined to suggest we stick with a winning choice, but I'm open to hearing Henry's input before we come to a consensus. What are your thoughts, Henry?

[Henry->all]: Hello everyone! I've reviewed our past experiences and given my personal preferences for meat dishes and the fact that I'm in good health with no dietary restrictions, American Flavors seems to be an excellent choice for us. I particularly enjoy meat-centered dishes, and the Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs have been consistently praised in our past visits. My reserved nature leans towards choosing a place where I know what to expect in terms of both food and service quality, and American Flavors has shown a high level of both. Given our affluent incomes, the price difference between the two restaurants is not a significant factor for me. I would be happy to visit American Flavors again. Shall we consider this for our next dining experience?

[Rachel->all]: Good evening everyone. Based on our previous experiences and my personal preferences, I am leaning towards choosing "American Flavors" for our dining experience tonight. The customer score is significantly higher than "USA Star Diner," and they offer a Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, which would cater to my lactose intolerance and dietary restrictions. While the "USA Star Diner" does provide a Veggie Power Bowl, the comments suggest it might lack flavor. I'm all for a gourmet dish that meets my sophisticated palate and health needs. What does everyone else think?

[Ruby->all]: Hello Rachel and everyone else. I'm in favor of "American Flavors" as well. As someone who has an affinity for sushi and gourmet tastes, I find the menu from "American Flavors" to be more appealing, particularly the Seasonal American Harvest Salad and the American Seasonal Special, which likely feature fresh and high-quality ingredients akin to what I would expect from sushi-grade fare.

Moreover, considering our past experiences, we've consistently enjoyed the offerings from "American Flavors", with personal scores reflecting satisfaction. Their service has been superior, aligning with my discerning nature. The price point, while slightly higher, fits within my affluent budget, and the menu seems to provide a good balance of delicious food and healthier options, ensuring a meal that aligns with my healthy lifestyle.

I'm open to hearing what Hugo and Henry have to say before we make a final decision.

[Hugo->all]: Hello Rachel, Ruby, and Henry. I'm inclined to agree with the choice of "American Flavors" for our meal. My gourmet taste buds are craving their Classic Cheeseburger, which has received consistent praise in our previous visits. I'm also intrigued by the BBQ Ribs and the American Seasonal Special, which promise to offer a fresh and flavorful experience.

While "USA Star Diner" has an appealing menu with the Signature Smokey BBQ Ribs and the Enhanced Juicy American Classic Burger, the overall customer score and our individual experiences suggest that "American Flavors" has a slight edge in terms of food quality and service. Given my healthy lifestyle, the availability of dishes like the Vegan Power Bowl and the Seasonal American Harvest Salad is a plus, ensuring that I can enjoy a delicious meal without compromising on my health.

Considering my leadership personality, I believe that "American Flavors" will not only satisfy my taste but also provide us with the superior service we're accustomed to. Let's hear from Henry now, and if we're all in agreement, we can make "American Flavors" our choice for tonight's meal.

[Henry->all]: Hey team, I appreciate everyone's input. Given my personal taste for meat, I'm also leaning towards "American Flavors." The Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs have been favorites of mine in the past, and they seem to get consistent positive feedback from all of us. I'm happy to see that they also offer a variety of dishes, which means I can indulge my meat preference while others have options that suit their dietary needs and preferences.

In terms of service, I value a place where I can enjoy my meal in a comfortable and reserved atmosphere, and "American Flavors" has provided that consistently. The price point is within reason for my affluent income, and I have no dietary restrictions to worry about, so I can fully enjoy their diverse menu.

With all things considered, I'm in agreement with choosing "American Flavors" for our dining experience tonight. Looking forward to enjoying another great meal with you all. Shall we move to the next round of discussion to finalize our decision?
