(If you want to summarize, only output this json data, without any other content!!!)

[Jake->all]: Considering my financial situation, health needs, and dietary restrictions, I think USA Star Diner would be the better choice. The prices are more affordable, which is important since my income is relatively low. They offer a Classic American Burger for $8, BBQ Ribs for $15, and Buffalo Chicken Wings for $7, which are all cheaper than American Flavors. Since I have high blood pressure and need to watch my sodium intake, I should avoid fried and high-sodium foods. USA Star Diner's menu includes options that could potentially be modified to be lower in sodium, such as the USA Star Salad for $5. I could ask for the dressing on the side or for a low-sodium dressing option. Additionally, the cheerful and friendly atmosphere that is suggested by the 'USA Star Diner' aligns with my jovial personality.

I would like to hear what others in the group think before making a final decision, but my initial preference is for USA Star Diner, focusing on their more affordable and potentially healthier options. What does everyone else think?

[Brian->all]: Given my financial circumstances and taste for street food, I'm inclined to agree with Jake on choosing USA Star Diner. The prices are more suitable for my budget, with most dishes costing significantly less than those at American Flavors. The Classic American Burger and Buffalo Chicken Wings are especially appealing and resonate with my preference for street food. Moreover, since I'm in good health and have no dietary restrictions, I can enjoy a variety of menu items without concern.

I also value resourcefulness, and USA Star Diner's menu seems to offer more value for the money, which is a smart choice in my situation. Before we make a final decision, I'd like to see if anyone has a different perspective or additional insights. But as of now, my vote goes to USA Star Diner for its affordability and variety that aligns with street food flavors I enjoy.

[Quinn->all]: I'm leaning towards USA Star Diner as well, primarily because their menu offers a range of options that suit my taste for spicy food at a more affordable price point. Their Buffalo Chicken Wings are only $7 compared to American Flavors' price of $12, which is a significant difference. Additionally, they have Chili Cheese Fries for $6, which could satisfy my preference for bold and spicy flavors. Plus, USA Star Diner's Smokey BBQ Ribs are priced at $15, which is $5 less than American Flavors' BBQ Ribs, allowing me to enjoy a hearty meal while staying within a reasonable budget.

Given that I'm healthy and without any dietary restrictions, I don't need to be overly concerned with the healthiness of each dish, but I still appreciate that there are lighter options available like the USA Star Salad. My bold personality is drawn to the promise of 'Innovative American Specials', suggesting that USA Star Diner might offer some interesting twists on classic American dishes. 

While I'm ready to cast my vote for USA Star Diner, I'm open to hearing any counterarguments or preferences from the rest of the group before we come to a consensus.

[Jake->all]: Given the discussions and the input from everyone, it seems like we're all in agreement that USA Star Diner is the best choice for us. The lower prices cater well to our budget constraints, and the variety in the menu offers options that satisfy our different tastes, ranging from spicy to classic American flavors.

As for my personal choice, I would like to order the USA Star Salad with the dressing on the side to manage my sodium intake and the Iced Americano for a refreshing beverage. These options are not only budget-friendly but also considerate of my health condition.

Does everyone agree with the selection of USA Star Diner, and shall we proceed to decide on the dishes we would like to order? If there are no objections or further suggestions, I think we could move forward with finalizing this decision in the next round.

[Brian->all]: It looks like we've reached a consensus on choosing USA Star Diner for our meal. Considering the preferences that have been mentioned, I would like to propose that we order a variety of dishes to share. Specifically, I suggest getting the Classic American Burger and the Buffalo Chicken Wings, which are both affordable and in line with my street food tastes. Additionally, the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Chili Cheese Fries seem like flavorful choices that Quinn might enjoy. 

As for a healthier option to balance our meal, we could include the USA Star Salad, as per Jake's preference. For dessert, the Apple Pie a la Mode offers a classic American sweet treat at a good price, and we can't forget a round of Iced Americanos for a refreshing finish.

If everyone is in agreement with these choices, we can move forward with this selection in the next round. Does this selection meet everyone's needs and preferences?

[Quinn->all]: It seems we're all on the same page about choosing USA Star Diner. The affordability and variety of spicy options appeal to me, and I'm looking forward to trying the Buffalo Chicken Wings and Chili Cheese Fries. The Smokey BBQ Ribs also sound like a great choice that fits within my budget. Since we all have health in mind, adding the USA Star Salad to our order will offer a fresh and lighter counterpoint to the other dishes.

I'm pleased that we've found a place that caters to our varied tastes and financial considerations. The 'Innovative American Specials' at USA Star Diner could be exciting to try, and I'm always up for a bold dining experience. If there are no other suggestions or objections, I think we're ready to finalize our decision with the proposed selections from Brian in the next round.

[Jake->all]: Hey team, considering our previous experience at USA Star Diner was quite positive, I'm inclined to suggest we go there again. I enjoyed the good balance of flavors and the prices were fair - important for my budget. I have to watch my sodium intake for my blood pressure, though, so I'm thinking of going for something like the USA Star Salad and maybe the Smokey BBQ Ribs if they can do them with less sauce. Their food was delicious and the service was great last time, which is a big plus for me. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: Hey folks, I agree with Jake that the USA Star Diner was a solid choice last time. Given my budget constraints, I'm always on the lookout for affordable meals, and USA Star Diner's prices seem to fit the bill quite nicely. I'm a big fan of street food, and their Classic American Burger and Buffalo Chicken Wings sound like they'd be right up my alley in terms of taste. Plus, we already know that the service there is good, which is always a bonus. I'm healthy and don't have any dietary restrictions to worry about, so I'm pretty flexible on the menu. Let's see what Quinn has to say, but I'm good with heading back to USA Star Diner and diving into some of those tasty options.

[Quinn->all]: Hey team, I'm all for returning to the USA Star Diner. The previous experience was indeed satisfying, and I'm excited to try more from their menu. My preference for spicy food draws me towards their Buffalo Chicken Wings and the Smokey BBQ Ribs. The ribs might not be the spiciest, but I'm sure they'll have that bold flavor I enjoy. Also, the Mac & Cheese Deluxe with smoky gouda and bacon sounds tempting. Price-wise, it's within my middle-class budget, and given that we're all in agreement about the great service, it seems like a no-brainer. Plus, being healthy with no dietary restrictions, I'm quite open to indulging in their rich, flavorful offerings. Let's round up our choices and make this meal happen at USA Star Diner! What do you guys think?

Brian enjoyed his Classic American Burger and found the Buffalo Chicken Wings decent for their price. Quinn also had a good experience with the ribs and the Mac & Cheese Deluxe. Let's sum up our scores and finalize our group review. Who wants to draft the final comment?

[Brian->all]: I can take a stab at the final comment. Everyone seems to have enjoyed their dishes with the flavors and quality meeting our expectations, especially for the price point. Our scores are consistently good across the board, which says a lot about the consistency of USA Star Diner. Here's a summary of our scores: Jake gave a 7.5 for the salad and 7.9 for the ribs, I gave a 7.3 for the burger and 6.8 for the wings, and Quinn rated the wings at 6.8, the ribs at 7.9, and the Mac & Cheese Deluxe at 7.1.

[Jake->all]: Hey team, I've looked at both menus and considering our past experiences at USA Star Diner, I'm leaning towards going there again. We've consistently enjoyed our meals and the prices are more budget-friendly, which is important for me. I love fried food, but I have to watch my sodium intake for my blood pressure. USA Star Diner has been great with accommodating dietary restrictions in the past. Plus, their service is always spot-on, which makes the dining experience even better for a jovial person like me. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: Hey everyone, I'm with Jake on this. My budget's pretty tight, and USA Star Diner is not only more affordable but also offers that homey street food vibe that I'm all about. The Classic American Burger and Mac & Cheese Deluxe sound right up my alley, and I can grab an Iced Americano for a caffeine kick without breaking the bank. Their service has been consistently good, which is a big plus. I say we stick to USA Star Diner for today's meal. How about you, Quinn?

[Quinn->all]: Hey Jake and Brian, I see your points, and I value the consistency and affordability of USA Star Diner. However, my preference for spicy food draws me towards the Buffalo Wings at American Flavors, which seems like it could offer a more delectable and fiery experience. I'm also curious to try their Patriot Pulled Pork, given its unique spice blend. I don't have any dietary restrictions, and my middle-class income allows for a bit of flexibility in terms of pricing. Plus, their higher customer score suggests that we might enjoy better overall quality and service. What do you think about giving American Flavors a shot this time? Their menu has a few items that could satisfy all our preferences and it might be nice to change things up. Let's discuss this further and come to a decision that suits us all.

[Jake->all]: Quinn, I appreciate your adventurous spirit and the desire to try out American Flavors. Their menu does look tempting, and I can see the appeal of the Buffalo Wings and Patriot Pulled Pork for someone who enjoys spicy food. However, given my health and budget considerations, I'm still inclined towards USA Star Diner. Their ability to cater to my low sodium needs has been proven, and I'm not sure if American Flavors would be as accommodating. Plus, the higher cost at American Flavors is a bit of a concern for me. We know what we're getting with USA Star Diner, and they've never let us down. But I'm open to hearing more if you think American Flavors can meet my needs and stay within a reasonable budget. Let's try to reach a consensus that makes everyone happy.

[Brian->all]: I hear both sides, and I appreciate the consideration for budget and health. Jake, like you, I have to keep an eye on my spending, and we've had good experiences at USA Star Diner. Quinn, the idea of trying new flavors at American Flavors is exciting, but I think the higher prices there might be a bit much for me. Given that we're all looking for delicious food and great service, but also need to consider our individual budgets and tastes, I think sticking with USA Star Diner might be the best compromise. We know their food is tasty, they've shown they can accommodate dietary needs, and it's kinder to my wallet. I'm up for trying American Flavors another time when my budget allows. How about we go for a mix of dishes that cater to our tastes and health preferences at USA Star Diner? We can get the spice from the Buffalo Chicken Wings for Quinn, and I can enjoy my burger and mac & cheese. Jake, you could go for something that fits your dietary restrictions. Does this sound like a plan?

[Quinn->all]: Jake and Brian, I appreciate your feedback and understand the concerns regarding budget and dietary needs. While I'm enticed by the spicy offerings at American Flavors, it's clear that the comfort and reliability of USA Star Diner are important to you both. The diner's capacity to accommodate health considerations is definitely a plus. Considering this, I'm willing to compromise and return to USA Star Diner, as it fits our collective criteria well. We can order the Buffalo Chicken Wings with an extra kick for me to satisfy my craving for spicy food, while ensuring we select other dishes that are in line with your health and budget requirements. Let's finalize our decision in the next round after ensuring we're all on the same page. Does this work for you?

We're selecting a variety of dishes that include the Buffalo Chicken Wings for Quinn's taste for spice, the Classic American Burger and Mac & Cheese Deluxe for Brian's preference for street food vibes, and the USA Star Salad, which can be customized to be low in sodium for Jake's health needs. This decision is a balance of our individual preferences and the diner's proven track record of delicious food, accommodating service, and budget-friendly prices."

The USA Star Salad was fresh and zesty, making it the best dish of the meal for me. My individual scores are: Wings - 6, Burger - 8, Mac & Cheese - 7, Salad - 8.

[Jake->all]: I must say that I'm pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of the meal. The Buffalo Chicken Wings were just the right level of spice for me, considering my blood pressure; I'd say they were fair. The Classic American Burger was good – it had a nice flavor and wasn't too heavy. The Mac & Cheese Deluxe was creamy and delicious, and I'm pleased with the USA Star Salad's freshness and the fact that it was low in sodium, which is great for my diet. Here are my scores: Wings - 7, Burger - 8, Mac & Cheese - 8, Salad - 8.

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, I've been looking at both menus, and I'm leaning towards USA Star Diner. Given my budget constraints and my love for fried food, it seems like a good match. Plus, we've been there before and had a pretty consistent experience. However, I need to watch my sodium intake for my blood pressure, so I'll have to ask for low-sodium options. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: Hi Jake, Quinn, I hear you on the USA Star Diner, and I agree it's been consistently good for us. My budget's tight, so the prices there are appealing, and I love street food vibes, which it definitely has. The Classic American Burger and Freedom Fries sound like they're right up my alley. I'm healthy and without dietary restrictions, so I'm flexible on the menu, but cost and flavor are key for me. How about you, Quinn? What's your take on the two places?

[Quinn->all]: Hey Jake and Brian, I appreciate your points on USA Star Diner, and I'm glad you both had good experiences there. But looking at American Flavors, the menu really catches my eye, especially the Buffalo Wings, which would satisfy my love for spicy food. Their customer score is also higher at 9.0 compared to 7.4 for USA Star Diner, indicating potentially better food and service quality. Plus, they have a loyalty program, which could be beneficial in the long run. The prices are a bit higher, but I think it might be worth it for the added deliciousness and variety. What do you guys think about giving American Flavors a try this time?

[Jake->all]: Quinn, Brian, I get what you're saying about American Flavors, and those Buffalo Wings do sound enticing! However, considering my health and the need to keep my sodium intake low, I'm a bit worried about the dishes at American Flavors. They seem a bit too indulgent and might not have as many options for me to customize for my dietary restrictions. I think USA Star Diner might be more accommodating in that regard. Plus, the prices at USA Star Diner are more within my budget. Quinn, I know you're keen on trying something with a bit more kick, but could we find a middle ground at USA Star Diner that satisfies us all?

[Brian->all]: I hear both of your points, and I think we can find a good balance here. While American Flavors has those higher scores and tempting dishes, it's also pricier, which might not be the best for my current financial situation. Jake, I get your health concerns, and it's important we choose a place that can cater to that. Quinn, the loyalty program at American Flavors is a nice perk, but maybe we can try it another time when we're all feeling a bit more flush? I reckon the USA Star Diner, with its more wallet-friendly prices and familiar menu, is our best bet for tonight. We know they've got tasty food that's also been consistent, and they seem flexible with dietary needs. Plus, I wouldn't mind saving a few bucks and still getting some good street food-style eats. How about we settle on the USA Star Diner for now and plan for American Flavors in the future?

Jake expressed a preference for the diner based on budget and past experiences, although he needs low-sodium options due to health concerns. Brian was also in favor of the diner due to its street food offerings and budget-friendly prices. While I was initially drawn to American Flavors for their spicy Buffalo Wings and high customer score, the consensus leaned towards the more affordable and accommodating USA Star Diner. Jake and Brian's concerns about budget and dietary needs were the main factors in our decision. We plan to consider American Flavors for a future outing when budget allows."

[Jake->all]: The Classic American Burger was pretty good, definitely met my expectations; I'd give it a solid 7. The Freedom Fries were just okay, a bit less than what I had hoped for, so I'm thinking a 6. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were the highlight for me, I'd rate them an 8. The Mac & Cheese Deluxe was decent, but could use a bit more flavor, so it's a 7 for me. USA Star Salad was fresh, it also gets a 7. The Apple Pie a la Mode was a nice finish, another 7. Overall, a good meal that didn't break the bank and accommodated my dietary needs.

[Brian->all]: The dishes at USA Star Diner were overall satisfying. The Classic American Burger had a good flavor and I'd give it a 7. The Freedom Fries didn't wow me, so they get a 6. The Smokey BBQ Ribs were the best part of the meal with a score of 8, they had a great taste. The Mac & Cheese Deluxe was nice but could have been cheesier, giving it a 7. The USA Star Salad was refreshing and deserving of a 7. The Apple Pie a la Mode was delicious, a perfect end to the meal with a 7. Good food for a fair price.

[Quinn->all]: The USA Star Diner offered a really enjoyable dining experience. The Classic American Burger was cooked well and tasty, earning a 7 from me. Freedom Fries were a bit lackluster, so they'll get a 6. Smokey BBQ Ribs were the standout dish with their rich flavor, deserving an 8. Mac & Cheese Deluxe was comforting, though I wished for a bit more sharpness in the cheese, so it's a 7. The USA Star Salad was crisp and balanced, also a 7. Apple Pie a la Mode was the perfect sweet note to end on, giving it a 7. Overall, a pleasant meal that catered to my preference for spicy and bold flavors.

[Jake->all]: Hey team, considering our experiences at USA Star Diner and the info on American Flavors, I'm leaning towards trying American Flavors today. They've got a higher customer score and some interesting menu items. I have to watch my sodium intake though, so I'll be avoiding dishes with too much salt. Their BBQ Ribs and American Combo Meal sound tempting. What do you guys think?

[Brian->all]: I'm on board with giving American Flavors a shot. The customer score is impressive, and the menu seems to offer a good balance between price and taste, which is perfect for my budget and street food preference. The American Combo Meal seems like a good deal, and I wouldn't mind trying those Sweet Potato Fries. Plus, their loyalty program could be useful since we eat out regularly. Let's see what Quinn has to say, but I'm in for American Flavors unless there's a major objection.

[Quinn->all]: American Flavors seems like an exciting option with its higher customer score and my preference for spicy food aligns well with their Buffalo Wings. I'm also curious about the Patriot Pulled Pork, considering my bold personality - it sounds like it packs a flavor punch! We've been to USA Star Diner consistently and while it's been good, I think it could be refreshing to try something new. The price points at American Flavors seem reasonable for my budget too. I agree with Jake on the BBQ Ribs and Brian's interest in the American Combo Meal. So, unless there are any other thoughts, I'd say let's go for American Flavors today.

[Jake->all]: Guys, I'm really pleased with our meal at American Flavors. The BBQ Ribs were delicious and not too salty, which is great for my diet. I'd give them an 8.7. The American Combo Meal was a great deal, and I'd rate it a 9.4. The Buffalo Wings were super tasty and just the right amount of spicy, so I'm going with a 9.7 for those! The Sweet Potato Fries were good but nothing too special, so maybe a 7.1, and the Patriot Pulled Pork was quite satisfying, I'd say a 7.8. Overall, a great dining experience! What do you guys think?

[Brian->all]: Truly a solid choice with American Flavors! The dishes were spot on with my street food vibe. The American Combo Meal was a highlight with its variety and taste, deserving a score of 9.4 from me. Those Buffalo Wings, though, absolutely delicious - they get a 9.7. Sweet Potato Fries were a nice touch, not extraordinary but still good, giving them a 7.1. BBQ Ribs were tender and flavorful, so an 8.7 seems fair. Patriot Pulled Pork had a good kick, so a 7.8 fits the bill. Can’t wait to hear Quinn's thoughts!

[Quinn->all]: The dishes at American Flavors were a delightful surprise, perfectly matching my love for spicy and bold flavors. The Buffalo Wings were exceptional, easily a 9.7 in my book. The BBQ Ribs had a nice balance of smokiness and sweetness; I'd give them an 8.7. The American Combo Meal was an excellent choice - hearty and satisfying, worthy of a 9.4 score. The Sweet Potato Fries, while not the star of the show, were still quite enjoyable, so I'd say a 7.1. Lastly, the Patriot Pulled Pork was robust in flavor, meriting a 7.8. Overall, a fantastic meal that hit all the right notes!

[Jake->all]: Hey folks, based on our previous experiences and my personal needs, I'm leaning towards American Flavors for our next outing. I've got to watch my sodium intake for my blood pressure, and it seems like they might have more options that cater to that. The Buffalo Wings and American Combo Meal were really impressive last time. Plus, their customer score is higher which might indicate better overall satisfaction. What do you all think?

[Brian]: I hear you, Jake. I enjoyed our meals at USA Star Diner, but I wouldn't mind trying something different. American Flavors does seem to offer a variety of dishes that could cater to everyone's tastes. I'm especially curious about the Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish. It might be a nice change.

[Quinn]: I'm on board with trying American Flavors again. Their dishes were a hit last time, and it looks like they have some new items that could be interesting. The loyalty program they offer might also be something we can take advantage of in the future. Let's see what the rest think! 

[Jake]: Great points, Brian and Quinn. I also noticed they have dishes that fit my love for fried food, but with a healthier twist. The Sweet Potato Fries and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish sound like they'd be delicious without being too heavy on the sodium. Plus, we've had pretty good experiences with their service and the food quality, right? 

[Brian]: Absolutely, Jake. The service was spot on and the quality of the food was memorable. It's worth giving American Flavors another visit.

[Quinn]: Agreed. If we're all on the same page, maybe we can look at the menu and decide on the dishes to order? We should consider options that cater to everyone's preferences and dietary needs.

[Jake]: Sounds good! Let's take a closer look at the menu and pick out some dishes. Remember, we've got to keep it budget-friendly too. I'm thinking we stick to a few of the favorites and maybe one or two new dishes to try. 

[Brian]: I'm with you on that. Let's make a list and see if we can come to a consensus on what to order. 

[Quinn]: Alright, let's do it. I'll start by saying the Vegan Power Bowl and the American Deluxe Combo would be my picks. They seem like good value for money and should be delicious.

[Jake]: I'd definitely want the Buffalo Wings again, and maybe we could try the Sweet Potato Fries and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish as well. That should keep it varied and interesting. 

[Brian]: Sounds like a plan. I think those dishes should satisfy everyone, and we're sticking to a reasonable budget too. Shall we finalize this in the next round?

[Quinn]: Yes, let's finalize our order in the next round. If we're all happy with Jake's suggestions, we can go ahead with that. 

[Jake]: Perfect, I'll get our proposal ready for the next round then. Thanks, guys!

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, considering our past experiences, I think we've enjoyed both places, but American Flavors seems to have edged out with higher scores on the days we visited. Personally, I love fried food, but I have to watch my sodium intake because of my high blood pressure. American Flavors has a variety of options that seem to cater to health-conscious needs while still offering delicious flavors, like the Vegan Power Bowl and the Buffalo Wings. Their Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish also sounds tempting and a healthier alternative to the usual fried food I go for. The prices are a bit higher, but the quality seems worth it, and I feel like I can find something that fits my dietary restrictions there. What do you guys think?

[Brian->all]: Hey Jake and Quinn, I'm leaning towards American Flavors as well. As much as I enjoy a good burger or ribs, the comments about American Flavors suggest that their dishes like the Buffalo Wings and American Deluxe Combo are exceptional. Given that I'm on a tighter budget, I'm always looking for a balance between cost and quality, and American Flavors seems to deliver on that. I also appreciate the variety in their menu, which means I can enjoy some street food-style dishes without breaking the bank. Plus, their customer score is quite impressive. Let's hear what Quinn has to say before we decide.

[Quinn->all]: I agree with both of you that American Flavors seems like a better choice. I have a preference for spicy food, and the Buffalo Wings there have been a hit every time. It's great that they offer a balance of flavor and healthier options since I'm health-conscious as well. On top of that, the service has been rated highly, and I'm always up for a place with superior service. The higher scores and positive comments about American Flavors make it stand out, and although the prices are slightly higher than USA Star Diner, I think it's worth it for the higher quality of food and service we seem to be getting there. Plus, being bold, I'm always open to trying new things, and their Flavor of the Month specials sound interesting. Let's all keep in mind that we're looking for delicious food, good service, and reasonable prices. It looks like American Flavors is our best bet on all accounts. If we all agree, I suggest we go there for our next meal.

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, I'm leaning towards American Flavors for our next meal out. Their menu seems to have a good mix of hearty and healthy options, and the customer scores are higher than USA Star Diner. Given my health concern with high blood pressure, I appreciate that they offer dishes like the Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish. Plus, the Sweet Potato Fries could satisfy my taste for fried food without too much salt. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: Hey Jake, I'm with you on American Flavors. I've got a tight budget, but their menu has some more affordable options like the Classic Cheeseburger and the Vegan Power Bowl that are within my range. Plus, the food they serve is more along the lines of the street food vibe that I enjoy. The customer scores suggest that the food will be delicious, and the service superior, so I'm expecting it'll be a good bang for my buck. How do you feel about this choice, Quinn?

[Quinn->all]: I'm definitely feeling American Flavors tonight. My love for spicy food has me eyeing those Buffalo Wings, and it seems like they've got a handle on bold flavors across the board, which suits my personality just right. Plus, the high customer scores and positive comments about their service and delicious food make it a no-brainer for me. Their Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish and Vegan Power Bowl also offer some healthier options, which is excellent. I'm all for maximizing our utility with delicious food, great service, and reasonable prices. Let's do this! Jake, Brian, it looks like we're on the same page for American Flavors. Shall we settle on that and pick our dishes?

[Jake->all]: Sounds great, team! It's a unanimous decision for American Flavors then. I'm looking forward to the Vegan Power Bowl, and I'd like to try the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish as well. The Buffalo Wings sounds like a great spicy option for you, Quinn. Brian, the Classic Cheeseburger should fit your budget and taste preference. Should we each get our preferred dish, and maybe share an American Deluxe Combo for variety? It includes the BBQ Ribs and Sweet Potato Fries, which seem like a good deal. What do you guys think about this idea?

[Brian->all]: I like the idea of sharing the American Deluxe Combo, Jake. It's a good way to get a little taste of everything. I'm definitely in for the Classic Cheeseburger—it's right up my alley and within my budget. The Vegan Power Bowl sounds like a solid choice too, for both health and price. We should consider getting a couple of sides as well, like the Sweet Potato Fries and maybe the New York Cheesecake for dessert. It's a bit of a splurge, but I think we can fit it in if we're careful with our other choices. How does that sound to everyone?

The Sweet Potato Fries could have been a bit crisper, but they were still enjoyable. The New York Cheesecake was a perfect end to the meal; it was rich and creamy, just as I hoped!

[Brian->all]: I'm really pleased with our choices at American Flavors. The Classic Cheeseburger hit the spot with its juiciness and flavor, definitely street food done right. The price was reasonable too, which is important for my budget. I'd give the burger a 9 out of 10. The American Deluxe Combo was a great way to sample different items, and I especially liked the BBQ Ribs. The Sweet Potato Fries were a bit less crispy than I'd like, so I'd rate them a 7 out of 10. The New York Cheesecake was a delight, earning a solid 9 out of 10 from me. Overall, I'd rate the entire meal experience an 8 out of 10. The service was excellent, which added to the enjoyment of our dinner.

The Buffalo Wings were a fiery delight and just the kind of spicy I crave, earning a 9 out of 10 from me. The Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish were both good choices for a healthier balance, I'd give them each a 7 out of 10. The American Deluxe Combo was a great shared dish, with the BBQ Ribs standing out, so that's an 8 out of 10. The Sweet Potato Fries were satisfactory but not exceptional, 6 out of 10 for those.

I'd give it an impressive 9 out of 10. The Vegan Power Bowl was a decent healthy option, but as someone who gravitates towards more traditional street food, I'd rate it a 7 out of 10. The American Deluxe Combo allowed us to try a bit of everything, and the BBQ Ribs were particularly good, so that's an 8 for me. The Sweet Potato Fries were a little on the limp side, which was a slight letdown, earning a 6.5 rounded down to a 6. The New York Cheesecake was a wonderful treat, rich and indulgent, deserving a 9 out of 10. Overall, considering the quality, service, and price, I would rate our meal experience at an 8 out of 10.

[Quinn->all]: The Buffalo Wings at American Flavors were a fiery treat that packed just the right amount of heat for a spice lover like me, definitely deserving a 9 out of 10. The Vegan Power Bowl, while not my usual go-to, was a flavorful and healthier choice that I'd rate at a 7 out of 10. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was a tasty alternative to traditional fried fish, earning a 7 out of 10. Sharing the American Deluxe Combo was a great decision; the variety was appreciated and I'd give it an 8 out of 10, especially for those BBQ Ribs. The Sweet Potato Fries were good but didn't quite hit the mark on crispiness, so a 6 out of 10 from me. However, the New York Cheesecake was an absolute winner, creamy and just the right level of sweetness for a perfect 10 out of 10. Overall, I'd say the meal was a solid 9 out of 10. The service was attentive and the atmosphere was just right for a dining out experience.

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, I’ve been reviewing both menus, and we need to consider a few things before making our decision. Given my limited budget, I’m leaning towards USA Star Diner since the prices seem a bit more affordable. I love fried food, but with my high blood pressure, I have to watch my sodium intake. I noticed that American Flavors offers a Vegan Power Bowl, which might be a healthier option for me. However, the USA Star Diner has that Lean Bison Burger that could be a good compromise between taste and health. I'm all for a jovial atmosphere with good service, and it seems both places have that covered. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: I hear you, Jake. I've got to keep an eye on the budget too, since I don't have a lot to spare. While American Flavors has a higher customer score and the food seems to be more delicious based on the reviews, their prices are a bit higher. I love street food and bold flavors, and from what I can tell, both places have options that would satisfy those cravings. I'm healthy, so no dietary restrictions to worry about, but I still appreciate a place that offers a good balance of indulgent and healthier options. I'm resourceful, so I'm confident we can find a good deal that doesn't compromise on taste. The USA Star Diner's menu, especially the Classic American Burger, looks like a great value for the price. What are your thoughts, Quinn?

[Quinn->all]: I've been looking at both options, and I definitely have a preference for spicy food, which is something to consider. American Flavors has the Spicy Southwest Burger that stands out to me, and looking back at our past experiences, we've enjoyed their food quite a bit, especially those Buffalo Wings that we all seemed to love. I don't have any dietary restrictions and I'm in good health, so I'm open to trying a variety of dishes. I'm also pretty bold, so I'm willing to go for something that has a kick to it. Price-wise, I'm comfortable with either option since my income is decent. Given our previous experiences and my personal taste for spicy food, I'm leaning towards American Flavors, even if it might be a little pricier. Their service seems to be superior as well, and since we all value a good dining experience, that's something to keep in mind. Let's find some middle ground that caters to our tastes and budgets. What do you both think about heading to American Flavors and maybe sharing some dishes to get more bang for our buck?

[Jake->all]: Quinn, I see your point about American Flavors offering a bit of a kick in their dishes, and I remember the Buffalo Wings being pretty good. But I'm still a bit concerned about the price. If we're talking about sharing, maybe we could get the American Deluxe Combo from American Flavors – it's got a good mix, and we all seem to like it. This could be a way to enjoy those flavors while keeping an eye on the cost. Plus, the Vegan Power Bowl could be a personal choice for me to keep it healthier. It's a little over my usual budget, but I'm willing to stretch it for a meal that we'll all enjoy. Brian, if we share, do you think you could handle the price at American Flavors? We could balance it out with some less expensive dishes too.

[Brian->all]: Sharing dishes at American Flavors sounds like a good plan, Jake. I'm definitely up for the American Deluxe Combo – it seems like a solid choice that gives us a taste of different items on the menu. The Classic Cheeseburger in the combo is right up my alley since I enjoy street food vibes, and it's a bonus that I can try a bit of everything. To manage costs, I'm thinking we could add something like the Caesar Salad to the mix. It's reasonably priced and would be a lighter option to balance out the meal. I'm okay with stretching the budget this time, as long as we stick to some of the less expensive items to round out our order. Let's make sure we get enough food for all of us, though. Quinn, are you okay with this idea? If we're all in agreement, I think we could make this work at American Flavors and enjoy some delicious food together.

[Jake->all]: I was really happy with the Vegan Power Bowl - it was tasty and fit my dietary needs well. The score from me is a solid 8. The American Deluxe Combo was a hit as well; sharing it was a great idea. The Caesar Salad was fresh and complemented the meal nicely, so I'd give that a 7. The Spicy Southwest Burger was a bit on the salty side for me, but the flavors were good, so that gets a 7 too. Overall, a good dining experience.

[Brian->all]: The American Deluxe Combo was definitely good value for money, and I enjoyed the variety it offered. I'd give it an 8. The Vegan Power Bowl had some great flavors that reminded me of some street food spices, so that's a 7 for me. The Caesar Salad was better than I expected; I'll give that a 7.5. The Spicy Southwest Burger had a nice kick to it, aligning with my love for bold tastes - a solid 8 from me. All in all, a satisfying meal that didn't break the bank.

[Quinn->all]: The Spicy Southwest Burger was right up my alley in terms of heat and flavor, definitely a highlight for me, so I'm giving it an 8. The American Deluxe Combo was delicious and offered a great mix of what American Flavors has to offer, deserving an 8.5. The Vegan Power Bowl was surprisingly satisfying, not something I'd usually go for, but I'd rate it at a 7. The Caesar Salad was a decent addition, not outstanding but good enough for a 7. Overall, a very enjoyable experience that met my expectations for both spice and quality.

[Jake->all]: Hey team, I've been looking at both restaurant options, and considering my budget constraints and health issues, particularly my high blood pressure and the need for low sodium options, I'm leaning towards American Flavors. Their menu has healthier options like the Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, which are more suitable for my dietary restrictions. Plus, the customer scores and our past experiences there have been consistently higher. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: Hello everyone, I've taken a good look at both menus and given some thought to our past experiences. Given my income, I'm always on the lookout for a meal that offers value for money. While USA Star Diner has lower-priced options that would suit my budget, American Flavors has been providing us with more delicious food and superior service, as our individual scores and comments reflect.

Even though American Flavors is slightly more expensive, the quality of the food and the overall dining experience seem to be better. I really enjoy street food and bold flavors, and dishes like the American Deluxe Combo and Spicy Southwest Burger from American Flavors sound like they'd hit the spot for me. Plus, they offer the loyalty program which could be beneficial in the long run.

I'm resourceful, so I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit for a meal that delivers on flavor and satisfaction. What do you think, Quinn? Are you leaning more towards one option or the other?

[Quinn->all]: I've been thinking about both options and considering my love for spicy food, I'm definitely in favor of American Flavors. They have the Spicy Southwest Burger that really appeals to my taste buds. Our past experiences there have been great - we've consistently given it higher scores compared to USA Star Diner.

Financially, I can afford either option on my middle-class income, and while I don't have any dietary restrictions, I appreciate the healthier choices American Flavors offers, which aligns with my overall health-conscious approach. Moreover, from a personality standpoint, I'm bold and prefer a restaurant that offers a diverse and flavorful menu, which American Flavors does.

The service at American Flavors has been superior, and I think the extra cost is justified by the higher quality of food and the dining experience they provide. It seems to me that American Flavors meets all our needs and preferences well. Would you guys agree on choosing American Flavors for our next meal together?

[Jake->all]: Given our previous discussions, it seems we're all in agreement that American Flavors offers a better dining experience overall, despite it being a bit pricier. Their menu caters well to my health needs with low sodium options like the Vegan Power Bowl, and they also have the delicious options that appeal to our group's taste for fried and flavorful foods. I'm comfortable with spending a little extra for a meal that's not only tasty but also meets my dietary requirements. Are we ready to make this our final decision?

Their customer score is higher, and the comments about their food are consistently positive. Plus, they seem to have options that could cater to my low sodium diet, like the Vegan Power Bowl, and they've impressed us before with dishes like the Buffalo Wings and American Combo Meal. My only concern is about the sodium content in some of their dishes, but maybe they can accommodate a low-sodium request? What do you guys think?

[Brian->all]: I agree with Jake, American Flavors seems to hit the sweet spot for us. I'm on a tight budget, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy a good meal. From our previous experiences, the food there has been both delicious and affordable. The Classic Cheeseburger and the American Deluxe Combo have been favorites of mine, and they're priced reasonably. And since I'm all about street food vibes, their bold flavors really appeal to me. I don't have any dietary restrictions to worry about, and I'm in good health, so I'm open to trying different things on the menu. What's most important for me is getting a good deal and enjoying a meal that tastes great, which American Flavors seems to provide. Let's see if Quinn has any input on this before we make a final decision.

[Quinn->all]: I'm all in for giving American Flavors another visit. The feedback we've had from our previous visits has been overwhelmingly positive, and I have to say, I'm really craving something spicy today. The Spicy Southwest Burger on their menu is calling my name with that fiery beef patty and jalapeños. Plus, I'm healthy and don't have any dietary restrictions holding me back from indulging in some bold flavors. The fact that American Flavors has a high customer score and consistently good service solidifies my choice. My budget as a middle-class individual shouldn't be too strained by their menu prices, especially considering the value we've gotten there before. Let's round up our thoughts and see if we're all on the same page for the next round of discussions. Jake, Brian, do you think we could go for that Spicy Southwest Burger along with some other dishes that cater to your needs as well?

[Jake->all]: I'm definitely up for returning to American Flavors. The Spicy Southwest Burger sounds like a great choice for you, Quinn, and I think the Vegan Power Bowl fits my dietary restrictions perfectly. Brian, the Classic Cheeseburger and the American Deluxe Combo seem like they'd be right up your alley as well. Considering our different tastes and requirements, it looks like American Flavors offers something for all of us. Plus, their service has been great in the past, which is a big plus. Unless there are any objections or other considerations, I propose we choose American Flavors and order the Spicy Southwest Burger, Vegan Power Bowl, and perhaps the American Deluxe Combo or the Classic Cheeseburger, depending on what you're feeling like today, Brian. Let's finalize this in the next round of discussion after everyone agrees. What do you guys say?

[Brian->all]: Jake and Quinn, glad to hear we're all in agreement about heading to American Flavors. I'm definitely down for the Classic Cheeseburger, and since the American Deluxe Combo includes it along with BBQ Ribs and Sweet Potato Fries, it seems like a great pick for me. It offers a variety and is cost-effective, which is perfect for my budget. The Spicy Southwest Burger for Quinn and the Vegan Power Bowl for Jake round out our meal choices nicely, covering all our bases in terms of taste and dietary needs. If everyone's on board with Jake's proposal, I say we lock in the decision and enjoy what promises to be another delicious meal at American Flavors. If there are no further comments or concerns, I'll be ready to summarize our order in the next round. Looking forward to it, guys!

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, considering our past experiences, American Flavors seems to consistently hit the mark for us, especially with their Buffalo Wings and American Deluxe Combo. Given my current health situation, I appreciate that they offer low-sodium options like the Vegan Power Bowl. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish also sounds like a tasty and healthier alternative. I'm leaning towards American Flavors for these reasons, plus their customer score is higher, and they have a loyalty program which could be great for us if we're dining out frequently. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: Hey Jake, I agree that American Flavors has been a great spot for us with high scores all around. Personally, I've been enjoying their bold flavors and variety, which suit my taste for street food. Plus, their prices seem reasonable for my budget. I particularly liked the Classic Cheeseburger and the New York Cheesecake from our last visits. The loyalty program definitely catches my eye too, as it could be a smart way to save some cash. On the other hand, USA Star Diner has some tempting offers, but based on our scores, it seems like American Flavors is the better choice for delicious food and service. Let's see what Quinn thinks before we make a final decision.

[Quinn->all]: Hey Jake and Brian, I'm with you on American Flavors. I'm all about that spicy life, and their Spicy Southwest Burger sounds like it'll hit the spot for me. Plus, our previous experiences there have been pretty solid across the board. I'm healthy with no dietary restrictions and a bold personality, so I'm up for trying their new spicy herb option on the Vegan Power Bowl too. Their customer score is higher than USA Star Diner's, and they seem to nail it on the flavor profile and service, which are big pluses for me. The loyalty program is a sweet deal as well. So, unless Brian or Jake, you have any objections or further insights, I'm all for heading back to American Flavors. What do you guys say?

[Jake->all]: I think we're all in agreement here. American Flavors has consistently satisfied our tastes and dietary needs, and I appreciate the healthier options they offer for my high blood pressure and low-sodium diet. We also seem to be getting good value for our money, and the loyalty program could be beneficial for us in the long run. My jovial personality always enjoys the friendly service there too. So, unless there are any last-minute thoughts or concerns, I propose we go for American Flavors and take advantage of the diverse menu that caters well to each of us. Shall we move to the next round and decide on the dishes?

[Brian->all]: No objections here. American Flavors it is! I think our choice is clear given the high scores, the mix of healthy and indulgent options, and the good service they're known for. Their menu fits my street food taste perfectly, and the prices are within my budget as well. Plus, I'm always up for enjoying a good meal that also offers savings through a loyalty program. So let's move on to selecting the dishes. I would still go for the Classic Cheeseburger, and I'd like to try the Spicy Southwest Burger this time. And let's not forget the New York Cheesecake for dessert. How about adding the Vegan Power Bowl with the new spicy herb option for some variety and the American Deluxe Combo for the group to share? That should give us a good mix of everything. What do you guys think?

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, I've been looking at our options, and honestly, I'm leaning towards American Flavors again. The food has consistently been delicious, and they seem to offer healthier options like the Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Fish, which could be better for my high blood pressure and low sodium diet. Their service has been great too. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: Hey Jake, I hear ya. American Flavors has been solid, and those dishes sound like they'd match your health needs. For me, cost is a pretty big deal since I'm on a tighter budget. USA Star Diner has slightly lower prices, and that Twisted Iced Americano sounds like a great, affordable pick-me-up. Plus, the Adventurous Avocado Veggie Burger is cheaper than the Vegan Power Bowl and still seems like a healthy option. I'm all for street food vibes, and USA Star Diner seems to have that casual, hearty feel to it. I'd be up for giving USA Star Diner a shot this time around. What's everyone else thinking?

[Quinn->all]: Both places have their perks, but I'm leaning towards American Flavors. I have a taste for spicy food, and their Spicy Southwest Burger seems like it would hit the spot. Plus, they've got a good mix of bold flavors and healthier options, like the Vegan Power Bowl, which means we can indulge without compromising on the health aspect. The New York Cheesecake also sounds tempting as a treat. I'm in a comfortable income bracket, so the slightly higher prices at American Flavors aren't too concerning for me. And I've had positive experiences there before with the food quality and service. However, I do see the appeal of USA Star Diner for its value and the Adventurous Avocado Veggie Burger that Brian mentioned. Perhaps we could consider ordering some dishes to share to cut down on costs and satisfy our different tastes and dietary needs? Let's round up everyone else's opinions and see if we can reach a consensus.

[Jake->all]: I do appreciate the value aspect that USA Star Diner brings to the table, Brian, and it's true that the prices are a bit more wallet-friendly. However, considering my health and the need for low-sodium options, American Flavors seems to offer more suitable choices. The Gluten-Free Fish would be a great alternative to fried food for me, and it's seasoned with herbs and spices which might help keep the sodium content lower. Quinn, I'm glad you're enjoying the spicier options at American Flavors. I think sharing dishes could be a good approach to keep costs down while allowing us to enjoy a variety of flavors. Plus, the customer score for American Flavors is higher, which might indicate a better overall experience. Let's see if we can find a balance that suits our health needs, taste preferences, and budgets. Maybe we can look at the healthier options that both restaurants offer and compare them more closely?

[Brian->all]: I'm seeing the points both of you are making. American Flavors does have a high customer score and offers those healthier options that are great for you, Jake. Quinn, that Spicy Southwest Burger does sound like it's right up your alley. I'm all about maximizing value, and while American Flavors has been great, I think USA Star Diner could give us a good bang for our buck. The Adventurous Avocado Veggie Burger and the Wholesome Veggie Power Bowl are both affordable and healthy. Plus, the Juicy American Classic Burger is less than the Classic Cheeseburger at American Flavors, which might help us save a few dollars. Sharing dishes is a smart move, and I'm willing to compromise if we can find a way to make eating at American Flavors more budget-friendly for me. Maybe we can focus on ordering some of the cheaper items on the menu or take advantage of any specials or loyalty discounts if they have them. What do you guys think about that as a potential solution?

[Quinn->all]: I've considered everyone's input, and it's clear that we're looking to balance health, taste, and budget. Brian, I understand the need to keep an eye on expenses, and Jake, your health requirements are important. I'm still in favor of American Flavors because they have a higher customer score and have consistently delivered great service and food that suits my preference for bold and spicy dishes. I propose we go with American Flavors, but we focus on getting the best value by choosing dishes that are both satisfying and cost-effective. The Spicy Southwest Burger is a must for me, but I'm open to sharing the American Deluxe Combo or the Vegan Power Bowl with the group to accommodate health needs and keep costs down. Maybe we can also make use of any loyalty program offers they have. I think it's a good compromise that respects our individual preferences and constraints. How does this sound to everyone?

[Jake->all]: The Classic Cheeseburger was excellent as usual, a solid 8.3 for me. The Vegan Power Bowl was surprisingly good, I'd give it a 7.3, especially considering my health concerns. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was tasty and seasoned well, a 7.3 there too. The Spicy Southwest Burger had a nice kick without being overwhelming, so that's a 7.6. The American Deluxe Combo was a great deal and delicious, deserving an 8.3. And the New York Cheesecake was just the right balance of creamy and tangy, I'll say 7.8. Overall, a very satisfying meal.

[Brian->all]: The Classic Cheeseburger lived up to its reputation - it was hearty and satisfying, so I'll give it an 8.3. The Vegan Power Bowl was a pleasant surprise, tasty and filling, so it gets a 7.3 from me. I didn't try the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, but it looked appetizing on the plate, so based on appearance alone, a provisional 7. The Spicy Southwest Burger was just the right amount of heat, earning a 7.6. The American Deluxe Combo was a hit for its variety and flavor, so that's an 8.3. And the New York Cheesecake was a sweet ending, warranting a 7.8. Overall, great choices for our group dinner!

[Quinn->all]: The dishes we chose from American Flavors really hit the mark for me. The Classic Cheeseburger was juicy and satisfying; I'd rate it an 8.3. The Vegan Power Bowl, with its diverse ingredients, was both health-conscious and flavorful, earning a solid 7.3. I didn't get to try the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, but it looked crispy and golden, so I'd tentatively give it a 7 based on presentation. The Spicy Southwest Burger had just the right level of spice for my bold taste, deserving a 7.6. Sharing the American Deluxe Combo was a great decision; the variety and taste get an 8.3 from me. And the New York Cheesecake was the perfect dessert to top it all off, so I'll give that a 7.8. A well-rounded meal overall.

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone, I've been looking at both American Flavors and USA Star Diner's menus and considering our tastes and dietary needs. I've had great experiences at American Flavors, especially with their healthier options like the Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish. Given my high blood pressure and low sodium diet, these options seem to align well with my health requirements. Plus, their customer score is higher, which suggests better overall satisfaction. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: Hey Jake, I hear you on the health-conscious options at American Flavors, and their high customer score is definitely enticing. However, I'm leaning a bit towards USA Star Diner this time around. They've got that Adventurous Avocado Veggie Burger and Wholesome Veggie Power Bowl, which seem right up my alley considering my love for street food. The prices are also a tad more budget-friendly, which I have to admit is a big plus for me given my current financial situation. The customer score is a bit lower, but the difference isn't huge. Quinn, what are your thoughts on this?

[Quinn->all]: Thanks for sharing your thoughts, guys. Looking at the menus, I'm gravitating toward American Flavors. My spicy food preference is calling out for their Spicy Southwest Burger and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish with that spicy herby batter. They seem to offer a nice kick that I'd enjoy. Plus, I've consistently rated American Flavors highly in the past, which tells me that I've enjoyed their food and service before. While I do understand the appeal of USA Star Diner's prices, I'm willing to pay a little extra for the higher satisfaction that American Flavors seems to bring. Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to an agreement.

[Jake->all]: I appreciate both of your perspectives. Brian, the budget-friendliness of USA Star Diner is certainly a valid point, especially considering your financial situation. Quinn, I understand your preference for spicy food, and the past positive experiences at American Flavors do carry weight. I'm still inclined towards American Flavors because of my health requirements, and their menu has items that cater to both my low sodium diet and my taste for fried food, like the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish. I think we should consider the overall satisfaction and healthiness of the food we choose, so I'm still inclined to go with American Flavors. Let's do another round of thoughts before we make a final decision?

[Brian->all]: It's great to hear your points, Jake and Quinn. I'm seeing the merits of both restaurants through our discussion. American Flavors does offer a variety of options that cater to our tastes and health preferences. I admit, I'm intrigued by the dishes that have been consistent hits, like the Classic Cheeseburger and the New York Cheesecake that I've rated highly before. On the other hand, USA Star Diner's more economical pricing is hard to ignore for someone in my financial position. However, if we're looking at maximizing our overall satisfaction, considering the higher customer score and my previous positive experiences, I'd be willing to stretch my budget a bit for American Flavors. The loyalty program might also offer some value in the future. I think I can be swayed towards American Flavors if we all agree that it's worth the little extra cost for a potentially better dining experience. Shall we finalize our thoughts in the next round?

[Quinn->all]: I appreciate the consideration of both health and budget in our discussion. Brian, your flexibility regarding the cost is commendable, and I think we might be able to find a middle ground that satisfies us all. Jake, your health needs are a priority, and it seems that American Flavors can accommodate those better. Given the consistently high scores I've given to American Flavors and my craving for something with a bit of spice, I'm still leaning towards choosing them for our meal. They seem to offer the best combination of delicious and bold flavors that can cater to our diverse preferences and dietary requirements. Plus, the superior service we’ve experienced there before is something I value. If we're all looking for a place that can offer a satisfying meal with great service, even if it's a bit pricier, I'd say American Flavors is the way to go. Let's wrap up our discussion in the next round and make our final decision. What do you say?

[Jake->all]: The Vegan Power Bowl was good, quite refreshing and aligned with my dietary needs. I'd rate it a 7.3 out of 10. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was also well-executed, and I appreciated that it was mindful of my health conditions. I'd give it the same score, 7.3.

Lastly, the Spicy Southwest Burger had a nice kick to it, scoring a 7.6. Overall, a satisfying meal with options that catered well to my health needs.

[Brian->all]: The Vegan Power Bowl was a pleasant surprise with its robust flavors, and I'd give it a solid 7.3 for hitting the spot with its street food vibe. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was tasty and had a good spicy kick, so I'll also rate it a 7.3. The Classic Cheeseburger was the star of the meal for me, especially since I've always enjoyed a good burger on the streets, so it gets an 8.3. The New York Cheesecake was creamy and satisfying, deserving a 7.8. The Spicy Southwest Burger, although not my usual street food pick, had a great flavor profile, and I'll give it a 7.6. Each dish was well-crafted and made for an enjoyable dining experience.

[Quinn->all]: The Vegan Power Bowl was good, but not as spicy as I would have liked. However, it was healthy and bold in its own way, so I'd give it a 7.3. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, with its spicy herby batter, was more to my taste and I'd rate it a 7.3. The Classic Cheeseburger, while not spicy, was really delicious and gets an 8.3 from me. The New York Cheesecake, although not spicy, was quite nice for a dessert, so I'd say a 7.8. The Spicy Southwest Burger was exactly what I was looking for in terms of spice and flavor, earning a solid 7.6. Overall, the meal was enjoyable and met my expectations in terms of flavor, especially with the spicy options.

[Jake->all]: It seems we're all pretty much in agreement about the quality of the dishes. We all enjoyed the Vegan Power Bowl, the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was a hit due to its spiciness, and the Classic Cheeseburger was the star for all of us. The New York Cheesecake provided a sweet and satisfying conclusion to our meal, and the Spicy Southwest Burger had the right amount of kick for those who wanted something with a bit more heat. I think we all felt the meal catered well to our tastes and dietary needs, with a good balance of health-conscious and indulgent options. Overall, it was a great dining experience at American Flavors. If we're ready, I can summarize our final review now.

If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Jake->all]: Hey everyone! I'm leaning towards American Flavors for our meal. They seem to have a higher customer score and the comments about their dishes are quite positive. Given my love for fried food, their Buffalo Wings or the Classic Cheeseburger would definitely satisfy my cravings. Plus, they have the Vegan Power Bowl and Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish, which sound like healthier options that could help with my high blood pressure and low sodium diet. What do you all think?

[Brian->all]: I agree with Jake on heading to American Flavors. Their menu has a good mix of hearty and healthy options, and the customer scores are consistently high. The Classic Cheeseburger and BBQ Ribs have been mentioned as standouts several times, and as someone who enjoys street food, those dishes speak to my taste. Plus, their prices seem reasonable, which is important for my budget. Their service also appears to be superior, which I value. Let's see what Quinn thinks, but American Flavors seems like a solid choice based on our criteria.

[Quinn->all]: American Flavors is definitely my top pick too. I have a penchant for spicy food, and it looks like their Vegan Power Bowl and the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish come with a spicy herb topping and zesty twist, respectively, which I'm eager to try. The comments suggest that they cater well to bold flavors, aligning with my personality. Additionally, I'm in good health with no dietary restrictions, so I'm quite open to a variety of options on their menu. Considering the service has been described as excellent and the dishes delicious, it aligns well with our collective goal of having a meal that offers both superior service and taste. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement on the dishes to order.

[Jake->all]: Alright, so it seems we're all in agreement about choosing American Flavors, which is great! I'm still a bit concerned about my high blood pressure and the need to keep my sodium intake low, but I think I could try the Vegan Power Bowl since it's a healthier option and it should align with my dietary restrictions. Plus, it has that bold flavor profile with the new spice blend, which should satisfy my taste for fried food without the health risks. How about we each pick a dish that we like and then we can share and sample a bit of everything? That way, we all get to enjoy a variety of tastes. What do you think about this plan?

[Brian->all]: The plan sounds good to me, Jake. I'm all for sharing different dishes. This way, we can all try a bit of what American Flavors has to offer. I'm definitely getting the Classic Cheeseburger, as I've got a soft spot for street food and it's been highly recommended. Given my budget, I think sticking to a couple of individual dishes rather than the more expensive combos would be best for me. Let's make sure to pick a few dishes that are both cost-effective and delicious. Quinn, do you want to pick a spicy dish for yourself? Then we can finalize our selections in the next round.

[Quinn->all]: Sharing dishes is a perfect idea, as it will allow us to taste a variety of flavors. I'm definitely going for the Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish because of the spicy and herby batter blend, which sounds delightful. Since I enjoy spicy food and we're looking to maximize deliciousness, I think it would be interesting to add the Vegan Power Bowl to our order as well, considering its bold new signature spice blend. This way, we can all enjoy a range of flavors and maintain a healthy balance. If you guys are okay with these choices, I think we're ready to make our final decision next round. Jake, your choice of the Vegan Power Bowl sounds good, and Brian, the Classic Cheeseburger is a must-have! Shall we finalize our order then?

[Jake->all]: That was quite a meal! The Vegan Power Bowl was good - the spice blend was on point and it felt like a healthier choice for me. It didn't quite hit the same spot as fried food usually does, but for a healthier option, I was pretty satisfied. I'd give it a solid 7. The Classic Cheeseburger was delicious, I snuck a bite from Brian, and it was definitely a highlight. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was tasty too, with the right amount of zest. Overall, I'm feeling good about our choices. What do you guys think?

[Brian->all]: The Classic Cheeseburger was everything I hoped for – savory, filling, and reminiscent of the street food I love. It's a solid 8 for me. The Vegan Power Bowl was surprisingly flavorful, and I appreciate how it caters to health-conscious people like Jake. It's a 7. The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish had a nice spice to it, and I'd also give it a 7. I'm quite happy with our dining experience at American Flavors. Quinn, your thoughts?

[Quinn->all]: The Gluten-Free Beer-Battered Fish was a standout dish for me with its spicy herb topping – a perfect match for my taste buds. I'd rate it an 8. Sharing the Vegan Power Bowl was a good call; its bold spice blend was impressive, earning it a 7 from me. I also had a taste of the Classic Cheeseburger, which was indeed delicious, so I'd give that an 8. I think we made a great choice with American Flavors; the food lived up to our expectations in terms of flavor and variety.
