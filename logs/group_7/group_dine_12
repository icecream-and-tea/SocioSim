[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.

    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>
}
(If you want to summarize, only output this json data, without any other content!!!)

[Nate->all]: Given my preferences and the information provided, I'm leaning towards "American Flavors" for the following reasons:

- I have a taste for grilled dishes, and the BBQ Ribs from "American Flavors" seem like they would satisfy that craving. The description of the ribs being "tender" and "smothered in our house BBQ sauce" sounds particularly appealing to me.
- The cozy ambiance mentioned in the advertisement of "American Flavors" appeals to my meticulous nature, as I appreciate a well-thought-out dining environment.
- Both restaurants have similar price points and American cuisine, so my decision isn't based on cost or variety of cuisine type but rather the specific appeal of the grilled items and the environment.

I would like to hear what others think before making a final decision.

[Vicky->all]: I'm feeling quite drawn to "American Flavors" as well. The menu items like the Classic Burger and Mac & Cheese are right up my alley when it comes to comfort food, which I really enjoy. Plus, I'm healthy and have no dietary restrictions, so I can indulge a bit. The cozy ambiance they mention sounds great for an easygoing person like me. 

On the other hand, "Stars & Stripes Diner" also has some appealing options like the Liberty Chicken Sandwich and the Revolution Ribs which sound delicious. Their loyalty program could be beneficial in the future, but since there's no customer score for either restaurant, I'm inclined to try the place that sounds more like a fit for my comfort food preference.

I'm interested in hearing from the rest of the group before we make a final decision. What does everyone else think?

[Steve->all]: Given my personal preferences and needs, I'm a bit torn between the two choices:

- From "American Flavors," the Caesar Salad and Apple Pie stand out to me. The salad could be a low-fat option suitable for my health condition, and the apple pie is a comfort food that I would enjoy. The cozy ambiance is a plus as I'm a friendly person who enjoys a warm atmosphere.
  
- However, "Stars & Stripes Diner" offers the Eagle's Nest Salad, which seems like a healthier choice due to the mixed greens and light vinaigrette, aligning with my dietary restrictions. The Patriot Pie also catches my attention for being a comfort food dessert.

While I am tempted by the comfort food options, I must prioritize my health, which includes managing my high cholesterol and sticking to a low-fat diet. I'm leaning slightly towards "Stars & Stripes Diner" because of the Eagle's Nest Salad, which seems to be the healthier option. The loyalty program is an appealing feature for me as a friendly individual who enjoys being part of a community.

I'd like to hear another round of thoughts before we come to a consensus, since it's important to consider everyone's preferences and needs. What's everyone's stance?

[Nate->all]: I appreciate the perspectives shared by Vicky and Steve. It's clear that we all value the quality of our food and the dining experience, but we also have to consider our individual health needs and preferences. 

- Vicky's preference for comfort food aligns with some of the options at "American Flavors" which could satisfy her cravings for classic American dishes.
- Steve's concern for a healthier meal choice points towards the "Stars & Stripes Diner" for the lighter salad option. 

I still believe that "American Flavors" could be a great choice for us because of the BBQ Ribs and the cozy ambiance, but I'm also willing to consider "Stars & Stripes Diner" if the group prefers a place with healthier options like the Eagle's Nest Salad. 

Considering the input from the group, I would suggest we put it to a vote in the next round to finalize our decision. Are there any other thoughts or shall we proceed to vote?

[Vicky->all]: Steve, Nate, your points are all well taken. It seems we're somewhat divided between the healthier options at "Stars & Stripes Diner" and the comfort food at "American Flavors." Given my preferences for comfort food and the fact that I'm healthy with no dietary restrictions, "American Flavors" still appeals to me more. However, I'm also very open to considering the health aspect for the group's benefit.

- "American Flavors" offers the Classic Burger and Mac & Cheese, which are my kind of comfort food, and the cozy ambiance suits my easygoing personality.
- "Stars & Stripes Diner" has the healthier Eagle's Nest Salad, which could be a good compromise for Steve's dietary needs, and the Liberty Chicken Sandwich does sound tempting as well.

I think it's important we find a balance that allows for both comfort and health-conscious choices. I'm ready to vote, keeping in mind the group's diverse needs, and I'm leaning slightly towards "American Flavors" for their comfort food options that I'm sure to enjoy. Shall we proceed with the vote to come to a decision?

[Steve->all]: It seems that we have a bit of a split decision here. On one side, "American Flavors" offers the kind of comfort food that both Vicky and Nate seem to enjoy, with Vicky particularly keen on the Classic Burger and Mac & Cheese and Nate on the BBQ Ribs. The cozy ambiance is a bonus for all of us, as we all appreciate a good dining atmosphere.

On the other hand, I have to be mindful of my high cholesterol and low-fat dietary restrictions, which makes "Stars & Stripes Diner" a bit more appealing to me. The Eagle's Nest Salad is a healthier option, but there are also comfort food options like the Patriot Pie, which I find tempting.

Considering all of our preferences and my health needs, I suggest that we lean towards a restaurant that offers both comfort food and healthier options. This way, we can satisfy our cravings while still being mindful of our dietary needs.

I'm ready to vote as well, and I'm willing to compromise by choosing "Stars & Stripes Diner" as it seems to offer a slightly healthier menu overall, which is important for my health condition. If the group agrees, we could go with "Stars & Stripes Diner" and choose dishes that cater to both the comfort food lovers and my dietary restrictions. Shall we finalize our decision with a vote now?

[Nate->all]: Overall, I found the meal at Stars & Stripes Diner to be fair. The Freedom Burger was decent but didn't quite meet my expectations for flavor and juiciness. The Revolution Ribs were satisfactory, but I've had more tender and flavorful ribs elsewhere. The Eagle's Nest Salad was fresh, which I appreciated, and the Liberty Chicken Sandwich was good but not exceptional. The Patriot Pie had a nice flavor but could have been a bit more rich in apple filling. I'd give the overall experience a 5 out of 10. What do you all think?

[Vicky->all]: The meal at Stars & Stripes Diner was acceptable but not impressive. The Freedom Burger was a bit dry, and I expected more from the patty. The Eagle's Nest Salad was fresh, which is good for a health-conscious choice, but it could use a more flavorful dressing. The Revolution Ribs were okay, though I've had juicier. The Liberty Chicken Sandwich was enjoyable; the avocado was a nice touch. The Patriot Pie was somewhat underwhelming; I anticipated a richer taste. I'd rate the overall experience as a 5 out of 10, as the dishes were fair but there's room for improvement. What are your thoughts, Steve?

[Steve->all]: The Stars & Stripes Diner provided a fair dining experience. The Freedom Burger was a bit lackluster in taste, and I had hoped for a juicier burger. The Eagle's Nest Salad was a good fit for my dietary restrictions, but it could benefit from a more flavorful vinaigrette. As for the Revolution Ribs, they were satisfactory, but they didn't stand out in terms of flavor. The Liberty Chicken Sandwich was decent, though nothing extraordinary. The Patriot Pie was comforting, yet it lacked the depth of flavor I associate with a great apple pie. My overall score would be 5 out of 10. Let's hear the final group thoughts before we wrap up our review.

[Nate->all]: After having our meal at Stars & Stripes Diner, here are my thoughts: The Freedom Burger was somewhat underwhelming; I expected a juicier and more flavorful burger. The Eagle's Nest Salad was fresh, but it could have been elevated with a more robust dressing. The Revolution Ribs were just okay – I was looking for that fall-off-the-bone tenderness, which was missing. The Liberty Chicken Sandwich was fine, not bad but not particularly memorable. Lastly, the Patriot Pie had a decent taste but didn't leave a strong impression. I'd rate the experience a 5 out of 10. Shall we summarize our feedback for the restaurant now?

[Nate->all]: Hey guys, considering our previous experience at Stars & Stripes Diner was just okay and looking at the menus, I'm leaning towards trying out American Flavors this time. They seem to have a more interesting selection with the Gourmet Truffle Burger and Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs that might offer the depth of flavor we were missing last time. What do you all think?

[Nate]: I agree with Vicky. As someone who loves grilled dishes, the Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs from American Flavors sound particularly appealing to me. Plus, my meticulous nature makes me curious about whether their promise of 'premium ingredients and innovative twists' will hold up. I'm in favor of giving American Flavors a shot.

[Steve]: I'm on the fence. I do like the sound of American Flavors’ upgraded menu, but I also appreciate consistency, and we know what to expect with Stars & Stripes Diner. However, I'm willing to be persuaded if the group thinks American Flavors could provide a better experience.

[Vicky->all]: I hear what you're saying, Nate and Steve. Given that we are looking for more flavor depth than what we got at Stars & Stripes Diner, I'm also inclined to give American Flavors a try. Their menu does seem to have a few comfort food options that appeal to my tastes, such as the BBQ Ribs and Mac & Cheese. Plus, I'm healthy and don't have any dietary restrictions, so I can choose freely from the menu. And since I'm easygoing, I'm up for trying a new place. So, I'm on board with going to American Flavors. Shall we discuss which dishes to try?

[Steve->all]: I appreciate the input from all of you. Given my high cholesterol and the need for low-fat options, I'm drawn to the Caesar Salad from American Flavors, which sounds like a healthier choice. I also have a soft spot for comfort food, and the Mac & Cheese could be a treat if it's not too heavy on the cheese. I'm friendly, so I'm happy to go with the group's consensus, and American Flavors does seem to promise a more intriguing culinary adventure. I'm willing to give it a shot, looking forward to some good service and hopefully more flavorful dishes. What do you all think of including the Caesar Salad and maybe the Mac & Cheese in our order? Are there any other dishes we're considering?

[Nate->all]: Steve, I think the Caesar Salad and Mac & Cheese from American Flavors are great choices for you considering your health preferences. As for me, I'm definitely interested in the Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs and the Gourmet Truffle Burger. They sound like something I'd enjoy, especially given my taste for grilled items. Vicky, since you mentioned comfort food and seem open to different options, do you have any specific dishes in mind? I think we should aim for a good mix of dishes to satisfy our individual tastes while also giving us a broad experience of what American Flavors has to offer. What does everyone else feel about this approach?

[Vicky->all]: Nate, I'm totally with you on getting a good mix of dishes. I'm really curious about the BBQ Ribs and Mac & Cheese at American Flavors since they fit the comfort food profile I enjoy. And even though I don't have a big income, I can splurge a bit since I'm healthy and don't eat out often. The Caesar Salad sounds like a fresh addition that Steve suggested, and I'm definitely interested in trying the Gourmet Truffle Burger as well—it sounds like a deluxe version of a classic comfort food. So, I'd say let's go for those four dishes: BBQ Ribs, Mac & Cheese, Caesar Salad, and the Gourmet Truffle Burger. Do we all agree on this selection, or is there anything else someone wants to add to the list?

[Nate->all]: Well, I found the Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs to be quite good, although they didn't quite hit the 'outstanding' mark for me. They had a nice balance of sweet and spicy, but I was hoping for a bit more complexity in the flavor. I'd give them a 6.6. The Gourmet Truffle Burger also had a good flavor, especially with the truffle and aioli, but again, it wasn't as exceptional as I'd expected. I think a 6.6 is fair for this one too. Overall, the dishes were decent but not as impressive as the advertisement led us to believe. What do you guys think?

[Vicky->all]: I have to say, the BBQ Ribs were fair, but I expected them to be a bit more tender and flavorful, so I'd rate them around a 6.4. The Mac & Cheese was comforting, but it was pretty standard and could have used a special touch, so I'd go with a 5.8 for that. The Caesar Salad was fresh but didn't stand out much from any other Caesar Salad I've had, so a 6.3 seems right. The Gourmet Truffle Burger had a nice gourmet feel with the truffle, so I'd give it a 6.6. It's been a satisfactory meal overall, but I hoped for a bit more given the descriptions and the prices. What about you, Steve? What are your thoughts on the meal?

[Steve->all]: The Caesar Salad was indeed fresh and the dressing was well-balanced, so I'd give it a 6.3. It was a good choice for my dietary needs. The Mac & Cheese had a nice creamy texture, but I did find it a bit heavy, considering my cholesterol situation; I'd rate it a 5.8. As for the Gourmet Truffle Burger, the flavors were good, but I think my expectations were set a bit too high from the advertisement; it gets a 6.6 from me. Overall, the experience was fair, but I was hoping for some dishes that would really stand out. Shall we wrap up our final thoughts?

[Nate->all]: Hey Vicky and Steve, I've been looking over the past experiences and the current offerings of both American Flavors and Stars & Stripes Diner. Given that we've had fairly average experiences at both places, I'm inclined to suggest we give Stars & Stripes Diner another shot. They seem to have updated their menu, and there are some grilled options like the Revolution Ribs and the Bald Eagle BBQ Burger that catch my eye, particularly because I love grilled dishes. Plus, the customer scores seem to be improving. What do you both think?

[Vicky->all]: Hey Nate, I appreciate your thoughts on this. Stars & Stripes Diner does have some comforting options that sound pretty good to me, like the Mount Rushmore Meatloaf and the Spiced Apple Caramel Pie. I'm all for giving them another chance, especially since they're advertising richer flavors now. I'm in a mood for some comfort food that's hearty and satisfying. What do you say, Steve?

[Steve->all]: Hey Nate and Vicky, I've taken a good look at both menus and considering my preference for comfort food and the need to watch my cholesterol and fat intake, I'm leaning towards Stars & Stripes Diner as well. The Eagle's Nest Salad seems like a great low-fat option, and I can indulge a little with the Liberty Chicken Sandwich, which sounds delicious and comforting. I'm also intrigued by the Spiced Apple Caramel Pie for dessert – it's a comfort classic with a twist. I'm happy to follow your lead on this one and give Stars & Stripes Diner another go. What do you guys think about the dishes? Shall we go for a mix of comfort and some healthier options to balance it out?

[Nate->all]: Great to hear that we're all leaning toward Stars & Stripes Diner. I like the idea of mixing comfort and healthier options. How about we get the Revolution Ribs and the Bald Eagle BBQ Burger for some grilled goodness, and balance it with the Eagle's Nest Salad? We should also try the Spiced Apple Caramel Pie that Steve mentioned. It sounds like a delicious dessert to round off the meal. Does this selection meet everyone's needs? If so, we can include this in our final decision. What are your thoughts, Vicky and Steve?

[Vicky->all]: Nate, the mix of dishes you've proposed sounds great to me. I'm definitely in for the comfort of the Mount Rushmore Meatloaf as well. I think it would complement the other choices well, and it's exactly the kind of hearty dish I'm craving. The Spiced Apple Caramel Pie for dessert is a must-try. I'm happy with the Eagle's Nest Salad for a healthier option as well. Steve, are you okay with adding the meatloaf to our order? If you and Nate agree, I think we'll have a good combination of dishes that everyone can enjoy.

[Steve->all]: Sure, Vicky, adding the Mount Rushmore Meatloaf sounds like a good plan to me. It's always nice to have variety, and the meatloaf would certainly round out our options. I'm glad we're including the Eagle's Nest Salad for a healthier choice, too. It looks like we have a well-balanced selection that caters to our tastes and dietary needs. Nate, if you're good with adding the meatloaf, I think we're ready to finalize our decision. Shall we go ahead and wrap this up?

[Nate->all]: Alright, let's talk about what we thought of the meal at Stars & Stripes Diner. I found the Revolution Ribs to be decent but they lacked the smokiness I was anticipating. The ribs scored a fair for me, same goes for the Bald Eagle BBQ Burger, which was just slightly better in flavor. The Eagle's Nest Salad was fresh, yet nothing out of the ordinary. The Spiced Apple Caramel Pie was good, with a nice balance of spice and sweetness, and the meatloaf was solid, but not spectacular. My scores for the dishes would be: Ribs - 5.5, Burger - 5.9, Salad - 5.3, Pie - 5.9, Meatloaf - 5.6.

[Vicky->all]: The meal at Stars & Stripes Diner was overall fair. The Revolution Ribs were tender but could use a bit more flavor; I'd give them a 5.5. The Bald Eagle BBQ Burger had a nice taste, a fair score of 5.9. Eagle's Nest Salad was quite standard, so it's a 5.3 for me. The Spiced Apple Caramel Pie had a pleasant flavor, deserving a 5.9. Lastly, the Mount Rushmore Meatloaf was hearty but not exceptional, earning a 5.6 from me.

[Steve->all]: The Stars & Stripes Diner offered a mix of comfort food that matched our group's preferences. The Eagle's Nest Salad was a decent low-fat option and had a fresh taste, so I'd rate it a 5.3. The Liberty Chicken Sandwich, which I did not have but was part of our group's consideration, likely would have been a better choice for me. The Revolution Ribs were fair, not as flavorful as I expected, so they get a 5.5. The Spiced Apple Caramel Pie was the highlight with its unique taste, so I'd give it a 5.9. The Mount Rushmore Meatloaf was quite hearty, but not as memorable as I'd hoped, so a fair 5.6 is my score for it. Overall, the diner provided a satisfactory experience that met our dietary needs, but there's room for improvement in flavor depth and dish execution.

[Nate->all]: Having completed our meal at Stars & Stripes Diner, I think we can all agree that the dishes were fair but there's certainly room for improvement in terms of flavor and execution. The Revolution Ribs and the Mount Rushmore Meatloaf were both decent, yet they lacked that special something to make them stand out. The Eagle's Nest Salad was fresh but standard, and while the Spiced Apple Caramel Pie was good, it wasn't outstanding. As for the Bald Eagle BBQ Burger, it was slightly better in terms of taste compared to the ribs and meatloaf. My overall score for the experience is a 6 out of 10. What are your thoughts, Vicky and Steve? Shall we rate the restaurant and provide our final comments?

[Vicky->all]: The Stars & Stripes Diner presented a menu that seemed promising for comfort food lovers like ourselves. The Revolution Ribs, while tender, were underwhelming in their lack of a smoky punch that I was expecting, meriting a score of 5.5. The Bald Eagle BBQ Burger was marginally better with a bit more flavor, so I'll give it a fair 5.9. The Eagle's Nest Salad, although fresh, didn't leave a remarkable impression, so it's a 5.3 for me. The Spiced Apple Caramel Pie stood out with its well-balanced flavors, deserving the highest score of 5.9. Finally, the Mount Rushmore Meatloaf, though hearty, did not particularly shine, earning a 5.6. In summary, the diner's offerings were adequate but could benefit from some enhancements in flavor to elevate the dining experience to the next level. My overall score for the Stars & Stripes Diner would be a 6 out of 10.

[Steve->all]: The dishes at Stars & Stripes Diner were generally fair, but none truly exceeded expectations. The Revolution Ribs had a decent tenderness but needed a richer, smokier flavor, earning a score of 5.5. The Bald Eagle BBQ Burger was slightly better, but still only fair at 5.9. The Eagle's Nest Salad was fresh but lacked standout qualities, so it gets a 5.3. The Spiced Apple Caramel Pie was the highlight with its pleasant blend of spices and sweetness, meriting a 5.9. The Mount Rushmore Meatloaf was comforting but could have been more flavorful, leaving it at a 5.6. Overall, I would rate our dining experience at a 6 out of 10. The potential for great comfort food is there, but the flavors need more depth and distinction.

[Nate->all]: Hey Nate and Steve, it's time to pick where we're eating today. Given our experiences, I'm leaning more towards American Flavors today. Their Gourmet Truffle Burger sounds like it could be a hit, and the Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs might have the grilled element Nate enjoys. What do you both think?

[Vicky->all]: Hey Vicky, definitely see where you're coming from. I did enjoy the Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs last time, but I felt like they could've been a bit spicier. I'm open to giving American Flavors another shot, though, because the Taste of America Sampler seems like a good way to get a bit of everything. How about you, Steve?

[Steve->all]: Hey Nate and Vicky, I appreciate the variety that American Flavors offers, and the American Harvest Salad seems like it would be a great fit for my dietary restrictions. Plus, their New England Clam Chowder might be a nice comfort food option that isn't too heavy on the fat. However, I'm a little concerned about the high cholesterol and fat content in the ribs and gourmet burgers. Maybe we could consider some lighter options too? What do you both think about including more salads or lighter dishes in our order?

[Nate->all]: I hear you both and I'm glad we're considering American Flavors again. I'm healthy and have no dietary restrictions, so I'm really looking forward to trying the grilled items on the menu. Steve, I understand your concerns about the fat content in some of the dishes, and I think the American Harvest Salad would be a great choice for you. It sounds delicious and healthy. Vicky, since you mentioned the need for a bit more spice, maybe we can ask if the chef can increase the spice level of the Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs for us? That way, we can all enjoy a bit of what we like. Shall we balance our order with a mix of grilled dishes and salads?

[Vicky->all]: That sounds like a solid plan, Nate. I'm all for making sure we have a balanced meal, and I think it would be great if we could customize the spice level on the ribs. The variety in the Taste of America Sampler also appeals to me, and it'll go nicely with the American Harvest Salad for some lighter fare. I don't have any dietary restrictions, and I'm always up for some comfort food. I'm open to trying the New England Clam Chowder too—it could be a nice start to the meal. Steve, would a combination of salads, the sampler, and potentially a lighter soup work for you? I think this variety would cater to our different preferences while keeping things interesting. What do you say we settle on American Flavors and finalize our order next round?

[Steve->all]: I like the direction we're heading with American Flavors. The mix of salads, the sampler, and the clam chowder seems like it would offer enough variety to satisfy our different tastes and dietary needs. I agree with the plan to ask for an adjustment on the spice level for the ribs, and I'm definitely on board with including the American Harvest Salad and New England Clam Chowder in our order. This way, I can enjoy some comfort food that's also mindful of my health. If we're all in agreement, I think we're ready to move forward and make this our final decision in the next round. How does that sound to you, Nate and Vicky?

The New England Clam Chowder was agreed upon by Vicky as a pleasant start to our meal, and Steve found it fitting for his dietary restrictions. We also plan to request an increase in the spice level for the Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs, addressing Vicky's preference for more heat, and including the Gourmet Truffle Burger which aligns with Nate's taste for grilled dishes. Steve's health concerns were taken into account by choosing lighter options and a soup that's comforting yet not too heavy. The group's meticulous nature was satisfied by ensuring that our individual needs were met while still enjoying a variety of flavors."

[Nate->all]: The Taste of America Sampler was a fair representation of the menu, though none of the items stood out as exceptional. The American Harvest Salad was fresh but could use more flavor. The New England Clam Chowder was comforting, but I've had better. Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs were good but could have been spicier, even after our request. The Gourmet Truffle Burger was the highlight, with a nice blend of flavors. I'd give an overall score of 6 for the food.

[Vicky->all]: The Taste of America Sampler was an adequate way to try a bit of everything, but it didn't wow me. The American Harvest Salad was decent, though I would have enjoyed a bit more dressing. The New England Clam Chowder hit the spot—it was hearty and felt like comfort food. The Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs were tasty, but I agree with Nate that they could've been spicier. The Gourmet Truffle Burger was enjoyable, with the truffle flavor coming through well. Overall, I'd say my experience was fairly good, so I'll go with a score of 7.

[Steve->all]: The Taste of America Sampler gave me a chance to sample various flavors, which I appreciated, but none of the items were particularly memorable. The American Harvest Salad was okay, but lacked a bit of zest which could have complemented the greens better. I did enjoy the New England Clam Chowder; it provided that comfort food experience without being too heavy. The Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs, while flavorful, didn't quite hit the mark on spiciness as anticipated. The Gourmet Truffle Burger was the best part of the meal, offering a rich flavor that I enjoyed. My overall score for the meal would be a 6.

[Nate->all]: The dishes at American Flavors were generally fair to good, with no single dish truly excelling beyond the rest. The Taste of America Sampler was a good introduction but lacked standout flavors. The American Harvest Salad was fresh but needed an extra punch. The clam chowder provided a sense of comfort, but I've had richer versions elsewhere. The Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs and Gourmet Truffle Burger were the better dishes of the evening, with the ribs needing more heat and the truffle burger delivering on its promise. I'd rate the overall experience a 6 out of 10.

[Vicky->all]: The meal at American Flavors was overall satisfying. The Taste of America Sampler was a fair way to start, though none of the dishes within it were particularly standout. The American Harvest Salad was fresh and the New England Clam Chowder offered that homey comfort food feeling, although the salad could have used a bit more dressing. The Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs had a nice flavor but didn't quite meet the spice level we were hoping for, even after requesting it to be spicier. The Gourmet Truffle Burger was probably my favorite, with a good blend of savory flavors. Overall, I'd give the dining experience a score of 7 out of 10.

[Steve->all]: The meal at American Flavors was a mixed bag for me. The Taste of America Sampler was a neat concept to taste a range of dishes, but none really stood out as a favorite. The American Harvest Salad was adequate, though it could have used a more robust dressing for my taste. I did find solace in the New England Clam Chowder; it had the comfort food vibe I was looking for and didn't feel too heavy. The Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs were okay in flavor, but I was hoping for a bit more kick to them. My highlight was the Gourmet Truffle Burger, which had a pleasing taste and didn't overpower with richness. Taking my dietary restrictions into account, I'd rate the overall meal experience a 6 out of 10.

[Nate->all]: The Taste of America Sampler was a decent introduction to the restaurant's offerings, but none of the individual items particularly impressed me. The American Harvest Salad seemed to lack a bit of zest, and while the New England Clam Chowder was a comforting choice, it wasn't the best I've had. The Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs were enjoyable, yet they failed to deliver the level of spiciness I was hoping for, even after requesting an adjustment. The Gourmet Truffle Burger was quite satisfying; the flavors were well-balanced and the grilled aspect appealed to my tastes. Overall, I would rate the meal a 6 out of 10.

[Vicky->all]: The Taste of America Sampler provided a nice variety, although each item was more comforting than exciting. The American Harvest Salad had fresh ingredients but could have been elevated with a bolder dressing. The New England Clam Chowder was indeed comforting and well-suited for my taste for comfort food, yet it didn't stand out as particularly noteworthy. The Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs were good, though I expected a bit more heat; nonetheless, they were enjoyable. The Gourmet Truffle Burger was tasty and quite satisfying, aligning well with my preference for comfort food with its rich flavors. Overall, I'd give the meal a score of 7 out of 10.

[Steve->all]: The variety at American Flavors was comforting and familiar, which I appreciated. The Taste of America Sampler was a good concept but didn't shine in terms of standout dishes. The American Harvest Salad was fresh, though a bolder dressing would have made it more enjoyable. The New England Clam Chowder was spot on for my liking—it was the kind of comfort food that suits my taste without feeling too indulgent. The Spicy Maple-Glazed Ribs were flavorful but lacked the spice kick I was anticipating, even after we asked for it to be spicier. The Gourmet Truffle Burger was the highlight for me; its rich flavor was satisfying without being too heavy, taking into account my need for low-fat options. I'd give this dining experience a 6 out of 10 overall.

[Nate->all]: Hey team, after reviewing both restaurants, I'm leaning towards American Flavors for our next meal. Their menu seems to have a broader range of grilled dishes, which I prefer, and their customer score is higher than Stars & Stripes Diner. Plus, they seem to be making an effort with new offerings like the Sizzling Steak Fajitas, which could be a hit for someone like me who enjoys grilled dishes. What do you all think?

[Vicky->all]: I hear you, Nate. American Flavors does have a higher score, and the variety in their menu is quite appealing. Since I'm on a budget and have a taste for comfort food, dishes like the Classic Burger and Mac & Cheese catch my eye, and they're reasonably priced too. The American Flavors Sampler could be a good way for me to try different items without breaking the bank. I'm healthy with no dietary restrictions, so I'm pretty open to anything. Plus, their Homestyle Apple Pie could be a nice treat to end the meal. Let's see what Steve thinks before we make a final call.

[Steve->all]: I appreciate the input from both of you, Nate and Vicky. Considering my health condition with high cholesterol and my need for low-fat options, I'm inclined to suggest the American Flavors restaurant as well. The American Harvest Salad and the New England Clam Chowder seem like dishes that would fit my dietary restrictions better. The salad offers a mix of greens and other healthy ingredients, and the clam chowder could be a comforting yet lighter option compared to some of the heavier dishes at Stars & Stripes Diner. 

On the other hand, I do enjoy comfort food, and items like the Mac & Cheese or the Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich are tempting. However, given my dietary needs, I'll have to pass on those. I'm also on a tight budget, but the prices at American Flavors look manageable. 

I'm friendly and open to trying new places, so I'm happy to go with the majority decision. Let's hear your thoughts and then we can think about confirming our choice in the next round of discussion. What do you say, folks?

[Nate->all]: Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Vicky and Steve. It seems like we're all on the same page about giving American Flavors a try. The variety on their menu caters to our different tastes and health considerations, and the pricing fits within our budgets. I think the American Flavors Sampler is a great choice for Vicky to satisfy her comfort food craving and budget-conscious approach. Steve, the American Harvest Salad and New England Clam Chowder sound like they would be suitable for your dietary needs. I'm excited about trying the Sizzling Steak Fajitas myself.

Since we're all leaning towards American Flavors, why don't we consider it as our choice? We can finalize our individual dish selections in the next round of our discussion. Does that work for everyone?

[Vicky->all]: I'm in agreement with you, Nate. American Flavors seems like a solid choice for us. I like the idea of the American Flavors Sampler to get a taste of everything, and the Homestyle Apple Pie really appeals to my love of comfort desserts. Steve, the healthier options you mentioned at American Flavors sound like they'd fit your needs well. I think we're all looking for a good mix of taste, health considerations, and value for money, and American Flavors looks like it can provide that. If we're all ready, I'd say let's go ahead and make our final decision in the next round. Looking forward to it!

[Nate->all]: The Sizzling Steak Fajitas were quite good; I'd give them a 7. They were grilled nicely and had a good flavor. However, the American Harvest Salad and the Homestyle Apple Pie were just fair, scoring them both a 6. They lacked a bit of the punch I was looking for. The Sampler was a great way to taste different things and I'd rate it a 7. Overall, I enjoyed the experience but there's room for improvement in flavor depth.

[Vicky->all]: The American Flavors Sampler and the Homestyle Apple Pie were comforting and pretty much what I expected, so I'd give them 7s. The variety in the sampler was nice, and the pie had that home-cooked feel to it. The American Harvest Salad was alright but nothing special, so it gets a 6. I'm happy with the prices and the portion sizes, and everything felt quite wholesome. Overall, a satisfying experience, but I wouldn't mind if the flavors were a bit more pronounced.

[Steve->all]: The American Harvest Salad was decent, but I was hoping for something a bit more flavorful, so it gets a 6.5 from me. The New England Clam Chowder was better than I expected for a low-fat option, so I'll give it a 6.8. It was comforting and had a good texture. Unfortunately, I didn't try the other dishes due to my dietary restrictions, but I'm glad to see that others enjoyed them. The restaurant's atmosphere was friendly and the service was good, which made the meal more enjoyable for me.

[Nate->all]: I found the experience at American Flavors to be quite amiable, and the Sizzling Steak Fajitas did not disappoint, earning a solid 7 from me for their well-grilled taste. The American Flavors Sampler offered a good variety, also deserving a 7. However, the American Harvest Salad and Homestyle Apple Pie, while satisfactory, lacked that extra flavor I was hoping for, so I rate them both at 6. Overall, the meal was enjoyable, but I believe there's potential for enhancing the flavor profile to elevate the dining experience.

[Vicky->all]: The American Flavors Sampler was a good choice for my palate, offering comfort food that I enjoy. I think it deserves a 7 because of the variety and the satisfying flavors, even if it wasn't outstanding. The Homestyle Apple Pie had that homemade taste I crave, so I'd also rate it a 7. The American Harvest Salad, though, was a bit underwhelming for me, so I'll give it a 6; it could use a little more seasoning to bring out the flavors. Overall, a good meal with room for some improvement in the taste department.

[Steve->all]: The American Harvest Salad was a fair choice given my dietary restrictions; it was fresh but could use an added zest, so I'll give it a 6.6. The New England Clam Chowder was comforting and surprisingly flavorful for a low-fat dish, earning a 6.8 from me. I enjoyed the friendly service, and the environment was welcoming, which always adds to the dining experience. From what I could tell, the other dishes were enjoyed by my companions, and the portion sizes seemed generous. The restaurant did a good job overall, but I'd love to see more low-fat yet flavorful options in the future.

[Nate->all]: Reflecting on our meal at American Flavors, my overall impression is positive. The Sizzling Steak Fajitas lived up to my expectations for grilled dishes, and I'd rate them a 7 out of 10. They were cooked well and had a satisfying taste. The American Flavors Sampler provided a good variety, and I also rate it a 7. However, the American Harvest Salad and the Homestyle Apple Pie didn't quite hit the mark for me, so they each get a 6. They could both benefit from a more robust flavor profile. The experience was enjoyable, and while the food was good, there's definitely room for some taste enhancement to make it great.

[Nate->all]: After reviewing the experiences and information for both American Flavors and Stars & Stripes Diner, I'm leaning towards American Flavors for our next meal. Their menu includes several grilled items which I'm a huge fan of. The Sizzling Steak Fajitas and the Bold BBQ Chicken seem like they would satisfy my taste for grilled dishes. Moreover, based on recent comments and our own past experiences, American Flavors seems to be showing consistent improvement, and their service was commended as well. My meticulous nature appreciates the attention to detail in service and the fresh ingredients they seem to use. Given that I'm on a tighter budget, their prices also seem reasonable, and I don't have any dietary restrictions to worry about. What do you guys think?

[Vicky->all]: I'm with Nate on this one, American Flavors sounds like a good choice for our next meal. I'm all about comfort food, and their menu has a variety of options that cater to that, like the Classic Burger and BBQ Ribs, which sound filling and satisfying. The place seems to have a friendly atmosphere, which is perfect for my easygoing personality. Plus, as a healthy eater, the American Harvest Salad and the Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich seem like they'd be both delicious and in line with my health-conscious approach. The prices are fair too, which is important for me considering my limited income. I'd love to hear Steve's thoughts before we decide, though!

[Steve->all]: I appreciate the insights from both Nate and Vicky. Considering my high cholesterol and the need for a low-fat diet, I'm inclined to agree with the idea of choosing American Flavors. They have options that could work for me, like the American Harvest Salad, which seems like a healthy choice. Additionally, the New England Clam Chowder could be a comforting yet still suitable option if it's not too creamy. I'm also on a budget, and the prices at American Flavors seem more accessible given my income. I value friendly service as well, which seems to be a strong point for American Flavors according to our previous experiences and the comments we've read. However, I'm open to hearing if anyone has any other opinions or considerations before we make our final decision.

[Nate->all]: It seems we're all in agreement about choosing American Flavors for our dining experience. The menu offers a variety of options that cater to our different tastes and health considerations, while also being budget-friendly. I'm particularly excited to try the Sizzling Steak Fajitas and the Bold BBQ Chicken, which align perfectly with my preference for grilled dishes. Vicky's interest in the Classic Burger and BBQ Ribs, along with the American Harvest Salad, suggests that the menu offers comfort food with a healthy twist. Steve's health concerns are also addressed with the salad and the New England Clam Chowder, which should fit into his low-fat dietary needs. Since we're all aware of the importance of good service and have had satisfactory experiences in the past, it seems like American Flavors is our best bet. Let's finalize our decision in the next round and make our order.

[Nate->all]: Overall, American Flavors delivered a good dining experience. The Sizzling Steak Fajitas were the standout dish for me, with a good balance of flavor and seasoning, earning a solid 7 out of 10. The Bold BBQ Chicken, while decent, could have used a bit more smokiness for my taste, so I'll give it a 6.5. The service was attentive as always, which I appreciate. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

[Vicky->all]: I must say, I really enjoyed the Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich, which was quite flavorful and had a great balance of sweet and smoky - I'd give it a 7. The American Harvest Salad was fresh and the ingredients were well-chosen, though I hoped for a little more punch in the dressing, so it's a 6.6 for me. The rest of the food was good and met my expectations for comfort food, but nothing was particularly exceptional. Service was friendly, which made the meal more pleasant. Can't wait to hear what Steve has to say!

[Steve->all]: The dishes at American Flavors were generally good. The American Harvest Salad was quite fitting for my dietary needs and tasted fresh, but could use a bit more flavor, so I'll give it a 6.6. The New England Clam Chowder was comforting and not overly creamy, which is good for my cholesterol, so it gets a 6.8 from me. Overall, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was very friendly, which I always enjoy. Let's wrap up our thoughts in the next round.

[Nate->all]: The meal at American Flavors was enjoyable with some dishes standing out more than others. The New England Clam Chowder met my health needs well and was quite satisfying, deserving a score of 6.8. While the BBQ Ribs were good, they lacked a little in the boldness of flavor that I was expecting, so they get a 6.5. Service was good, and the overall experience was positive. I think we can come to a consensus for our final review now.

[Vicky->all]: I found American Flavors to be a pleasant place to dine. The BBQ Ribs were comforting and fairly good, earning a 6.5 from me. The Classic Burger was satisfying, but I felt it could have had a bit more flavor to make it stand out, so I'll give it a 6.6. The service was very friendly and welcoming, which is just what I like. Overall, a good experience with room for some improvement in the flavor department. Looking forward to summarizing our final thoughts in the next round.

[Steve->all]: The meal at American Flavors was quite good overall. I particularly enjoyed the New England Clam Chowder, which was well-suited to my low-fat diet and scored a 6.8 in my book. The dishes were generally in line with my comfort food preference, although I did find some of them could have used a bit more seasoning to enhance the taste. Given the friendly service and the atmosphere that catered to my personality, I'd rate the overall experience as a 6.7. Shall we go ahead and put together our final review?

[Nate->all]: Alright, let's talk about what we had. The Sizzling Steak Fajitas and Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich were good; they lived up to my expectations for grilled dishes with a score of 7.1 each. However, I found the American Harvest Salad and Homestyle Apple Pie to be just fair, giving them a 6.6. The New England Clam Chowder was also fair, so a 6.8 for that. It's a shame the dishes weren't as bold in flavor as advertised, but overall, it was a decent meal. What do you folks think?

[Vicky->all]: I'd say the Sizzling Steak Fajitas and Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich were quite satisfying with a score of 7 each for their taste and the quality of the meat. The American Harvest Salad and the Homestyle Apple Pie were alright but not as impressive, so I'd give them a score of 6.5 – they could use more punch in flavor. The New England Clam Chowder was good, hearty, and comforting, deserving a score of 6.8. All things considered, the meal was good but there's definitely room for improvement in terms of delivering on the bold flavors they promised.

[Steve->all]: I think Nate and Vicky have made some good points. The Sizzling Steak Fajitas and Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich were the highlights of the meal with their flavors and execution, and I'd agree with a score of 7 for both. The American Harvest Salad was a bit underwhelming considering my dietary needs; it could have been more flavorful, so I'd say it was a fair attempt, earning a 6.5. The New England Clam Chowder was quite enjoyable without being too heavy, deserving a 6.8. The Homestyle Apple Pie was a fair end to the meal, but I'd hoped for a lighter, less rich dessert, so it gets a 6.6. Overall, the experience was good but not extraordinary.

[Nate->all]: Reflecting on the meal, I have to agree with the rest of the group. The grilled items like the Sizzling Steak Fajitas and the Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich were the stars and I'd rate them both at 7. They met my expectations for grilled dishes quite well. The American Harvest Salad and Homestyle Apple Pie, while decent, didn't impress me as much; I'd give them both a 6.5. The New England Clam Chowder was good, with a nice balance of flavors, so that's a 6.8 for me. Overall, the meal was satisfactory with some dishes standing out more than others, but I believe there's a potential for American Flavors to enhance their offerings further.

[Vicky->all]: Reflecting on our meal, I think the Sizzling Steak Fajitas and the Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich were the most enjoyable, with a score of 7 for both, as they offered the comforting and hearty flavors I look for. The American Harvest Salad and Homestyle Apple Pie were just okay, not quite hitting the mark on that comfort experience I anticipated; I give them a 6.5 each. The New England Clam Chowder was good and quite satisfying, scoring a 6.8. Overall, the meal was good, but I think American Flavors could bump up the flavors a notch to truly live up to their name and our expectations.

[Steve->all]: Reflecting on everyone's feedback, I concur with the general sentiment. The Sizzling Steak Fajitas and Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich did stand out with their well-executed flavors, justifying a score of 7 for each. The American Harvest Salad, while fresh, lacked the bold taste I was hoping for given my health considerations, so I'd give it a 6.5. The New England Clam Chowder was hearty and not overly rich, which I appreciated, and I'd rate it a 6.8. The Homestyle Apple Pie had the right idea but was a tad too sweet for my liking, so it gets a 6.6 from me. In totality, the meal was good, but with a bit more attention to the richness and boldness of flavors, it could have been great.

[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members.

2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Nate->all]: I've been analyzing our past experiences and based on our scores and comments, I feel that while both restaurants have room for improvement, American Flavors has shown a consistent upward trend in satisfaction. As someone with a meticulous nature, I appreciate the gradual improvements they've made. 

I have a particular fondness for grilled dishes, and I've noticed that American Flavors has a few options that could satisfy that craving, like the BBQ Ribs and the Firecracker Steak Fajitas. Given that I'm in good health and have no dietary restrictions, I can indulge a bit. Also, our income is on the lower side, so we should consider value for money as well.

Considering our tastes and the overall better scores for American Flavors, I would lean towards choosing them again. What do you think, Vicky and Steve?

[Vicky->all]: I agree with you, Nate. American Flavors seems to be the better choice for us, especially given our preferences for comfort food and how their scores have been consistently improving over the days. The dishes you mentioned, like the BBQ Ribs and Firecracker Steak Fajitas, sound really appealing to me as well, and they're right up my alley in terms of flavor.

We should also keep in mind that while we're not rolling in dough, the prices at American Flavors seem fair for the quality we're getting. Plus, the service and atmosphere have been noted as friendly, which is always a nice bonus and fits with my easygoing personality.

Steve, what's your take on this? Are you leaning towards American Flavors as well, or do you have a different perspective?

[Steve->all]: I've been listening to both of your points, and I have to say I'm inclined to agree with the choice of American Flavors. My health condition requires me to be mindful of cholesterol and fat intake, so I appreciate that they offer a variety of dishes that seem to be on the healthier side, like the American Zest Harvest Salad and the New England Clam Chowder. These dishes would allow me to stick to my dietary restrictions while still enjoying a satisfying meal.

Given my friendly personality, a place with a good service and a friendly atmosphere, as Vicky mentioned, is definitely a plus for me. And considering my income level, I'm also looking for a place that offers good value for money, which seems to be the case with American Flavors based on the fair prices and consistent scores.

So, all things considered, I'd be happy to go with American Flavors for our meal. Shall we move forward with this choice and decide on the dishes to order?

The New England Clam Chowder was hearty and flavorful, deserving a 7.3. The Sampler was a great way to taste different items, and I think it deserves a 7.6 for variety and taste. Lastly, the Gourmet Truffle Burger Deluxe was a treat, especially with the truffle-parmesan fries, so that's a 7.3 from me.

The Gourmet Truffle Burger Deluxe was very flavorful, and the truffle-parmesan fries were a highlight, so that gets a 7.3.

[Nate->all]: Hey team, considering the experiences we've had so far and the feedback, I'm leaning towards American Flavors for our next meal. They've been consistently good, and the improvements in their menu items like the Firecracker Steak Fajitas and Gourmet Truffle Burger Deluxe seem to align more with my taste for grilled dishes. Plus, they have a higher customer score than Stars & Stripes Diner. I think the service there has been quite good too, and as someone meticulous, I appreciate the attention to detail. What do you all think? 

[Vicky]: What's your opinion on this? 

[Steve]: And yours?

[Vicky->all]: I'm in agreement with Nate on this one. American Flavors has shown a positive trend in both their culinary offerings and overall customer satisfaction. Their menu seems to have evolved to offer more flavorful versions of their dishes, which I think aligns well with my preference for comfort food with a bit of a gourmet touch. The Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Caramel Apple Pie Deluxe sound particularly tempting. Considering my budget, American Flavors also seems to offer good value for money, and their service has been commended. I'm open to trying their enhanced dishes, especially since they cater to a variety of tastes and seem to maintain a healthy balance. Let's hear Steve's thoughts before we make a final call.

[Steve->all]: Considering the options, I'm inclined to agree with both Nate and Vicky. American Flavors seems to have a consistent record of good service and dishes that cater to comfort food lovers like me. I have high cholesterol and a dietary restriction that requires low-fat options, so their enhanced menu with items like the American Zest Harvest Salad and the Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich (which I can ask to be modified to reduce fat) could be suitable for my health needs.

Additionally, given my friendly personality, the positive remarks about the atmosphere and service at American Flavors appeal to me. Financially, it makes sense too as the prices seem reasonable and within my budget. I'd be interested in trying the Gourmet Truffle Burger Deluxe, but I'd request it without the cheese to keep the fat content lower. The Caramel Apple Pie Deluxe could be a nice treat as long as I keep my portion small. Let's see if our opinions align and we can come to a consensus on American Flavors for our next dining experience. What do you both think of the dish selections considering my restrictions and preferences?

[Nate->all]: I think Steve's considerations for health are important, and it's great that American Flavors can cater to those needs with some modifications to dishes like the Gourmet Truffle Burger Deluxe. The American Zest Harvest Salad seems like a perfect fit for a healthier option too. Given that we all have shown a preference for American Flavors and have highlighted dishes that appeal to our individual tastes and needs, I'm all for choosing this restaurant. The price point is reasonable for my budget, and the variety allows us to enjoy a range of flavors. If we're all in agreement, I'd suggest we could finalize on American Flavors and make our dish selections in the next round. What do you both say? Shall we move towards a final decision?

[Vicky->all]: Nate and Steve, it sounds like we have a consensus on American Flavors. The menu has several options that accommodate our tastes and health considerations while also being budget-friendly. I'm particularly looking forward to the Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich and would like to try the Caramel Apple Pie Deluxe for dessert. Since we all seem satisfied with the choice and have dishes in mind that meet our requirements, I propose that in the next round, we finalize our decision to dine at American Flavors. If there are no objections or further points to discuss, let's make this our plan. Shall we proceed?

[Nate->all]: Given my preferences for grilled dishes, healthy options, and my meticulous nature, I'd lean towards American Flavors for our next dining experience. Their Firecracker Steak Fajitas and American Flavors Sampler seem to cater well to my tastes for grilled foods. The revamped Gourmet Truffle Burger Deluxe also sounds appealing, especially with the more robust truffle aioli mentioned in the advertisement, which might satisfy my meticulous palate.

The consistent scores of 7 and above for American Flavors over the past few days also indicate a satisfactory experience that aligns well with my health-conscious approach to dining. The American Zest Harvest Salad offers a healthy option that seems flavorful, and the Ultimate American Spice Feast could be an exciting choice for our group, given its variety and bold flavors.

Looking at our past experiences, it's clear that American Flavors has shown a slight but consistent improvement in our ratings, suggesting they are attentive to customer feedback and are improving in service and culinary offerings. This aligns with my meticulous nature as I appreciate establishments that strive for continuous improvement.

I'd like to hear your thoughts and see if American Flavors also aligns with your dining preferences.

[Vicky->all]: [Nate], I'm inclined to agree with your assessment regarding American Flavors. As someone with a taste for comfort food, the menu items like the BBQ Ribs, American Flavors Sampler, and the Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich resonate with my preferences. The American Zest Harvest Salad also catches my eye as a healthy choice that doesn't seem to compromise on flavor, which is essential for me.

The customer scores and our individual experiences with American Flavors suggest that the restaurant has been consistently good, although there is always room for improvement. Based on the recent comments and the restaurant's commitment to enhancing flavors as seen in the advertisement, it seems they are taking steps to provide a more satisfying dining experience, which is promising.

Given that we don't have any dietary restrictions and we're looking for a friendly atmosphere with good service, American Flavors seems to fit the bill. Plus, the variety in their menu could cater to our easygoing nature, allowing us to choose from different types of comfort food depending on what we're in the mood for.

I'd like to hear [Steve]'s input before we make a final decision, but American Flavors is currently at the top of my list for our next meal. What are your thoughts, [Steve]?

[Steve->all]: I've been reviewing the options, and I have to say that American Flavors really stands out to me as well. My main concern is my health, given my high cholesterol and the need for low-fat options. The American Zest Harvest Salad and the American Flavors Sampler offer a balance between health-conscious choices and the comfort food I enjoy. Plus, the attentive service mentioned in the comments is always a bonus for a friendly guy like me.

I also noticed that the Gourmet Truffle Burger Deluxe, while decadent, might be a bit too rich for my dietary restrictions. However, the Ultimate American Spice Feast sounds like a great way to enjoy a variety of flavors without overindulging in any one dish that might be too fatty.

Looking at the scores and comments, it seems like American Flavors has been consistent and responsive to feedback, which I appreciate. The variety in their offerings means I can choose dishes that are both comforting and better for my health.

I'm leaning toward American Flavors for our meal, and I'm curious to hear what you both think of the specific dishes I've mentioned, especially considering my dietary needs. Shall we consider American Flavors then, and discuss which dishes would be best for us?

[Nate->all]: It appears we are all in agreement about choosing American Flavors for our dining destination. The menu items cater to our various preferences, and the establishment seems to value customer feedback and continuous improvement, which is important to me.

Considering our health-conscious approaches and the importance of a balanced meal, I suggest we include the American Zest Harvest Salad for its vibrant and healthy ingredients. The Firecracker Steak Fajitas would be a great option for my love of grilled dishes, and since we all seem to be intrigued by the Ultimate American Spice Feast, it could offer us a taste of diverse, bold flavors.

For a satisfying and potentially healthier meat option, the Sweet & Smoky Pulled Pork Sandwich might be a good choice, as it provides comfort food without being too heavy. Finally, the Gourmet Truffle Burger Deluxe could be a luxurious treat for us to share, ensuring we don't overindulge while still getting to enjoy its rich flavors.

Let's finalize our choices in the next round of discussion, making sure to consider the balance of flavors and dietary considerations. If you have any adjustments or additional suggestions, please share them so we can come to a consensus for our meal at American Flavors.

[Vicky->all]: I think we've reached a good consensus on choosing American Flavors. The selections you've both mentioned sound great and align well with my own preferences for comfort food that's also mindful of health.

The American Zest Harvest Salad is definitely on my list for its health benefits and flavor profile. I'm excited about the BBQ Ribs, as they epitomize comfort food for me, and considering the positive comments, they're likely to be delicious. The American Flavors Sampler also seems like a perfect way for us to try a bit of everything without committing to a single dish.

Given our past experiences and the continuous improvements at American Flavors, I'm looking forward to trying the dishes we've discussed, especially the Firecracker Steak Fajitas which have been consistently mentioned as a standout. I agree with Nate's suggestion to share the Gourmet Truffle Burger Deluxe, which allows us to indulge without going overboard.

I am happy with the choices we've outlined and think they'll make for a well-rounded meal that satisfies our tastes and health considerations.

[Nate->all]: Hi all, considering our previous dining experiences and the current offerings, American Flavors seems to have a slight edge. They're consistently improving and the variety of grilled dishes aligns with my taste. Plus, the recent scores and comments have been positive. What do you think?

[Vicky]: I agree with Nate. American Flavors has shown improvement and the menu options seem to cater well to our group's diverse tastes. Their service is also commendable. I'm leaning towards going back there.

[Steve]: I'm on the fence. Stars & Stripes Diner's Ultimate BBQ Platter sounds tempting, especially during their Happy Hour. I feel like we might be missing out if we don't give it another chance. But I can understand why you both would prefer American Flavors. 

[Nate]: True, the BBQ Platter does sound great, but considering the overall satisfaction and the fact that I'm a fan of grilled dishes—which American Flavors has been good at—I still think we should stick to American Flavors. Plus, they've been attentive to health, which is important to me.

[Vicky]: Steve, I get your point, but American Flavors seems to be the safer bet for a satisfying meal. Their Sampler and Truffle Burger have been hits and could be a great choice for us again.

[Steve]: Alright, considering the majority opinion and the fact that American Flavors has been consistently good, I'm willing to go with that. Let's give their new dishes a try as well. Nate, since you're meticulous, why don't you propose the final solution?

[Nate]: Sounds good. I'll draft the final proposal for our next round of discussion. Thanks, guys!

[Vicky->all]: After considering everyone's input, I propose we go to American Flavors for our meal. They've been consistent with their service and the variety on the menu seems to please everyone's palate. If there are no objections, I think we should give their new Smokey Mountain Chicken a try, along with the favorites like the American Flavors Sampler and the Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme. We've enjoyed these before, and they cater to our tastes for comfort food with a touch of indulgence. What are your thoughts?

[Vicky]: I think that's a solid plan, Nate. The Smokey Mountain Chicken sounds like a healthy option, and I'm always up for the Sampler and Truffle Burger. I'm in favor of this choice.

[Steve]: I'm good with that as well. The Sampler and Truffle Burger have been great in the past, and I'm curious about the Smokey Mountain Chicken. Let's go with American Flavors.

[Nate]: Great, it seems we're all in agreement. I'll put together our final decision then.

[Nate->all]: The American Flavors Sampler was a hit for me, loved the variety and flavor. I'd give it an 8.1. The Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme was also delicious, especially the truffle flavor coming through; I rate it a 7.9. The Smokey Mountain Chicken was good, healthier than I expected, and I'd rate it a 7.4. Overall, a satisfying meal.

[Vicky]: I thoroughly enjoyed the Sampler, it was outstanding with a score of 8.1. The Truffle Burger was good, rich in flavor, so a 7.9 from me. The Smokey Mountain Chicken was quite nice, a bit healthier as Nate mentioned, giving it a 7.4.

[Steve]: The Sampler was great, full of flavor, so it's an 8.1 for me. The Truffle Burger was good but didn't wow me as much as last time; I'm giving it a 7.9. The Chicken was nicely done and a healthier option, so I'll give it a 7.4 as well. 

[Nate]: It looks like we're all pretty much in agreement on the scores. I can summarize our final review in the next round unless anyone has any objections or further comments?

[Nate->all]: I've noticed that our experiences at American Flavors have been consistently improving, especially with the recent focus on grilled options, which are my personal favorite. The restaurant seems to be doing a better job at meeting our health and taste preferences, and I've found the service to be attentive. I'm leaning towards going back to American Flavors because of this positive trend and because the menu contains several grilled dishes that I enjoy.

[Vicky]: I agree with Nate. American Flavors has been on an upward trajectory, and the feedback on the menu items like the Firecracker Steak Fajitas and the Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme has been quite positive. The variety in their menu also offers something for everyone, which is important for our group.

[Steve]: I'm in favor of giving Stars & Stripes Diner another shot. Their Spiced Apple Caramel Pie was a highlight during our last visit, and they have introduced the Patriot's Plant-Based Burger, which could be a great option for those looking for healthier or vegan choices. We might be pleasantly surprised by their new offerings.

[Nate]: While I understand Steve's point about giving Stars & Stripes Diner another chance, I think American Flavors has shown more consistent improvement and seems to better match our group's preferences overall. Plus, their menu has several items that I'm eager to try again, especially the grilled dishes.

[Vicky]: Nate, I see your point about American Flavors' consistency, and given that they've been accommodating our tastes well recently, I would support your suggestion to dine there again. How about we give it one more try and see if they continue to meet our expectations?

[Steve]: I'm still curious about the new items at Stars & Stripes Diner, but I can't deny that American Flavors has been more reliable in terms of quality and service lately. If you both feel strongly about it, I'm willing to go with the majority and choose American Flavors again.

[Nate]: Thanks, Steve. I appreciate your flexibility. If we go to American Flavors, I propose we try some of their standout dishes that we've enjoyed before, like the American Flavors Sampler and the Firecracker Steak Fajitas, along with some new selections to keep things interesting. Shall we finalize this in the next round?

[Vicky]: Sounds like a plan, Nate. I'm in favor of that selection, and it would be nice to try a mix of familiar and new dishes.

[Steve]: Alright, let's finalize American Flavors for our next dining experience with a combination of our past favorites and some new choices. I'm curious about the Ultimate American Spice Feast, so let's include that in our order.

[Nate->all]: I was really impressed with the American Flavors Sampler; it's a solid dish showcasing the restaurant's capabilities. The Firecracker Steak Fajitas had the right amount of spice and were cooked perfectly. The Ultimate American Spice Feast was a nice addition, offering variety and bold flavors. The Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme was good, though I expected a bit more truffle flavor. The American Zest Harvest Salad was fresh and a good contrast to the other dishes. I'd give an overall score of 8.

[Vicky]: The American Flavors Sampler was outstanding, a great way to taste different items. The Firecracker Steak Fajitas were flavorful and well-prepared. The Ultimate American Spice Feast provided a delicious heat that was just right. The Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme, while tasty, could use an extra truffle punch. The American Zest Harvest Salad was refreshing. My overall score is also an 8.

[Steve]: The sampler was a delightful start, and I particularly enjoyed the variety it offered. The Firecracker Steak Fajitas were a highlight with their robust flavor. The Ultimate American Spice Feast hit the mark with its selection of spiced meats. The Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme was underwhelming in terms of truffle flavor. The salad provided a nice balance. I'd rate the meal an 8 overall. 

[Nate]: It seems we are all in agreement on the quality of the meal. I'll compile our final review in the next round based on our scores and comments.

[Nate->all]: Hey everyone, I've been thinking about our dinner plans, and I'd like to share my thoughts. Considering our recent experiences, I feel that American Flavors has been consistently improving in both service and the quality of their dishes. Their grilled options, like the Firecracker Steak Fajitas and the Patriotic Prime Ribeye Steak, have been particularly enjoyable, aligning with my preference for grilled dishes. Given our income constraints, I believe the prices at American Flavors also offer us a fair value for the quality we receive. What does everyone else think?

[Vicky->all]: I agree with Nate on leaning towards American Flavors. We have been having some good experiences there, and I'm really into comfort food, which they seem to do well. The Enhanced Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme sounds like it could be a real treat, and I'm curious to see how they've amped up the truffle flavor since it's been a bit of a talking point in the comments. That being said, I'm also conscious of our budget, and I think American Flavors gives us some good options without breaking the bank. Plus, I'm all about a friendly and easygoing atmosphere, and it sounds like American Flavors has that down. Steve, what are your thoughts on this?

[Steve->all]: Hey Nate and Vicky, I've been listening to what you've both said about American Flavors, and it seems like a good fit for us. Personally, I'm looking for comfort food that's also mindful of my high cholesterol and low-fat dietary restrictions. It looks like American Flavors has options that could work for me, such as the American Zest Harvest Salad, which seems healthy and flavorful. I also noticed they have a New England Clam Chowder that might satisfy my comfort food craving without being too heavy on the fat, especially if I share it with someone. I'm all for a restaurant with friendly service, which seems to be a highlight in our previous experiences at American Flavors. I'm leaning towards choosing them as well, but I'm open to hearing more if anyone has further thoughts or preferences! What do you all think?

[Nate->all]: It's good to hear that we're all leaning towards American Flavors. I think it caters well to our various tastes and health considerations, and I'm glad to see that they have both indulgent and healthier options. Steve, I think sharing the New England Clam Chowder is a great idea to keep it lighter. I'm definitely in for the grilled dishes, especially the Patriotic Prime Ribeye Steak. I'm also interested in trying the American Flavors Sampler to get a taste of different items on the menu. Since we are all pretty meticulous about our choices and have a tight budget, do you guys think it would be wise to share a few dishes to get a broader experience without overspending? Shall we go for a final decision in the next round?

[Vicky->all]: I'm on board with sharing some dishes at American Flavors. It seems like a good strategy to enjoy a variety of their offerings without going over our budget. The Sampler is a great choice for that, and I'm definitely up for the Enhanced Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme. Maybe we can add a salad or something lighter to balance it out. Sharing the Clam Chowder sounds like a plan too, Steve. It could keep things light for you while still letting you enjoy some comfort food. I think we've all made some good points, and it looks like American Flavors is the place that will satisfy our diverse preferences. If we're all in agreement, I suggest we finalize our decision in the next round of our discussion. What do you all say?

[Steve->all]: I'm glad we're all considering American Flavors. Sharing dishes is definitely the way to go, especially with my dietary restrictions in mind. The American Zest Harvest Salad and New England Clam Chowder seem like smart choices for me, keeping the low-fat and high cholesterol considerations in check. I'm happy to split the Clam Chowder with someone to keep my portion size down. The Sampler also sounds appealing as it gives us a chance to try different items. Since we're looking to be cost-effective, I'd suggest we focus on a few shared dishes that satisfy our comfort food cravings while also being mindful of my health. If we're all set on this, then I think we're ready to move to the final decision. Shall we proceed?

[Nate->all]: I'm quite satisfied with our meal tonight. The Patriotic Prime Ribeye Steak was perfectly grilled, just the way I like it. The American Flavors Sampler allowed us to taste a variety of what the restaurant has to offer and it didn't disappoint. The New England Clam Chowder was flavorful and comforting, though I did expect a bit more richness in terms of flavor. Overall, I'd rate my experience an 8 out of 10. What did you all think of the meal?

[Vicky->all]: I thought the meal was really enjoyable. The Enhanced Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme lived up to the hype, and I loved the depth of truffle flavor. The BBQ Ribs were good too, tender and well-seasoned. The American Zest Harvest Salad was fresh and had a nice kick to it, complementing the other richer dishes. For me, the overall experience was good. I'd give it an 8 out of 10 as well. Can't wait to hear what Steve thinks!

[Steve->all]: The dinner was quite good, considering my health and dietary restrictions. The American Zest Harvest Salad was flavorful without being too heavy, and the New England Clam Chowder was a good compromise for my comfort food craving—it was creamy but didn't feel overly indulgent. I appreciate the balance of flavors and the careful attention to dietary needs in the dishes we chose. I'd also rate the experience an 8 out of 10, as it met my expectations for comfort while still being mindful of health.

[Nate->all]: It seems we're all in agreement about the quality of our meal at American Flavors. The dishes we chose were a hit across the board, with the Sampler providing a great taste of the menu, and the specific dishes like the Patriotic Prime Ribeye Steak, the Enhanced Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme, and the New England Clam Chowder meeting our expectations for flavor and quality. I'm particularly impressed with how the dishes catered to our individual tastes and dietary needs while still allowing us to enjoy a shared dining experience. I'd rate our meal an 8 out of 10, too. The food was good, service was great, and I think we made excellent choices considering our income and taste preferences. Who would like to summarize our discussion and provide the final review?

[Nate->all]: Hey everyone, given our budget and preferences, I’m leaning towards continuing with American Flavors. They've been consistent with their service and the quality of their grilled dishes. I'm particularly interested in trying the Patriotic Prime Ribeye Steak and seeing if the Enhanced Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme lives up to its name. Plus, their menu seems to be more aligned with my taste for grilled dishes and our group's health consciousness. What do you all think?

[Vicky]: I've enjoyed the meals at American Flavors before, and the American Flavors Sampler has been a hit with us. I'm curious about the Vegan Powerhouse Burger and the Harvest Salad for some healthier options. The service has always been good, which is a plus for me.

[Steve]: I'm all for a place with a friendly atmosphere and good service. American Flavors seems to have a diverse menu that caters to our different tastes, but I wouldn't mind checking out the new Star-Spangled Steak at Stars & Stripes Diner. It could be a nice change.

[Nate]: I understand wanting to try something new, Steve. However, considering our group's consistent satisfaction with American Flavors and my personal preference for grilled dishes, which they seem to excel at, I suggest we stick with American Flavors for now. We can always explore Stars & Stripes Diner another time when we're feeling more adventurous. Does that sound like a plan to everyone?

[Vicky]: That sounds reasonable to me, Nate. I agree that American Flavors has been meeting our expectations well, and it's important we choose a restaurant that caters to all our tastes and health considerations.

[Steve]: Alright, I'm on board with going to American Flavors again. The consistent good scores are hard to argue with, and I've enjoyed the meals there too. Let's do it.

[Nate]: Great, it looks like we have a consensus. I'll put together our final decision.

The Sampler is always a good choice, so an 8.1 from me. The Vegan Powerhouse Burger was impressively good for a plant-based option, scoring it an 8.1.

[Vicky->all]: The meal tonight at American Flavors was excellent. The Patriotic Prime Ribeye Steak was flavorful and well-seasoned, definitely an 8.1. The Enhanced Luxurious Truffle Burger Supreme had a great truffle taste, and I'd also rate it an 8.1.

The Vibrant Vegan Powerhouse Burger was a pleasant surprise, and I give it an 8.1 too.

Two rules:

If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Nate->all]: Hey everyone, considering our past experiences and my personal preferences, I'd lean towards American Flavors again. The restaurant has consistently delivered satisfying grilled dishes, and that's really what I'm in the mood for. Plus, they have health-conscious options that align with my desire to eat healthily. The service there has also been top-notch, which is something I value. What do you all think?

[Vicky]: I see your point, Nate. I've also enjoyed our meals at American Flavors, especially the American Flavors Sampler and the Truffle Burger. However, I'm a bit curious to try something new, and Stars & Stripes Diner has that Classic American Burger with a bold twist of spices. It could be interesting to see how their revamped menu is stacking up now.

[Steve]: I'm torn. American Flavors has been great, but I agree with Vicky that it might be nice to change things up. Stars & Stripes Diner's customer score is lower, but that doesn't always mean much. I'm curious if they've improved since we last considered them. Nate, would you be willing to give Stars & Stripes Diner a shot, or are you set on American Flavors?

[Nate]: I'm willing to consider Stars & Stripes Diner, but I'm concerned about the lower customer scores and the comments suggesting the flavors could be more bold. I'm meticulous about my food, and American Flavors has been consistent. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach a consensus.

[Vicky->all]: I hear what you're saying Nate, and consistency is certainly important. I enjoyed the meals at American Flavors too, but I think it's worth considering that while Stars & Stripes Diner has lower scores, it also seems to be aiming for some bold flavors, which appeals to my taste for comfort food. Although I'm healthy and don't have dietary restrictions, I appreciate a restaurant that tries to keep things interesting. Since we've been to American Flavors multiple times, why not give Stars & Stripes Diner a chance to see if they've stepped up their game? If their Classic American Burger and Spiced Apple Caramel Pie live up to the promise, it could be a great experience. What do you think, Steve? Would you be up for giving Stars & Stripes Diner a chance this time around?

[Steve->all]: I'm leaning towards giving Stars & Stripes Diner a chance. While the experiences at American Flavors have indeed been consistently good, a little variety could be refreshing. Plus, with my high cholesterol and low-fat dietary restrictions, I have to be a bit careful with what I eat. Stars & Stripes Diner's Patriot's Plant-Powered Burger sounds like a healthier option that could meet my dietary needs. And if the diner has taken feedback into account and improved its offerings, we might be in for a pleasant surprise. I'm friendly and open to trying new things, so unless there are strong objections, I'd be willing to vote for Stars & Stripes Diner this time. What do you both say? Shall we give it a shot or stick to what we know is good at American Flavors? Let's decide in the next round.

[Nate->all]: Well, I've been thinking about what both of you said, and I'm willing to compromise. Even though I have a strong preference for grilled dishes and have enjoyed the consistency of American Flavors, I understand the appeal of trying something different. Stars & Stripes Diner's menu does have a few items that could satisfy my grilled tastes, like the Revolution Ribs and the Star-Spangled Steak. Plus, the idea of a Spiced Apple Caramel Pie does sound tempting. So, I'm open to the idea of giving Stars & Stripes Diner a try, as long as we make sure there are some health-conscious options on the table as well. Vicky, Steve, if you're both set on trying out the Diner, I'm game. Let's make a decision in the next round of our discussion.

[Vicky->all]: Alright, it seems we're all open to giving Stars & Stripes Diner a try. Nate, I understand your concerns about the bold flavors and consistency, but it looks like we're all curious about how the diner has evolved since the last reviews. Steve, the Patriot's Plant-Powered Burger at Stars & Stripes Diner does sound like a good fit for your dietary needs, and I'm glad you're up for the change as well. Since we're all leaning toward trying something new and the diner's menu has options that cater to our tastes and health considerations, I say we go for Stars & Stripes Diner this time. If everyone agrees, let's finalize this in the next round and decide on the dishes we want to try. How does that sound?

[Nate->all]: Well, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed with the Star-Spangled Steak and Revolution Ribs. I expected the flavors to be more robust and the grilling to be on point. They were just fair, not what I'd hoped for. The Classic American Burger was alright, but again, just fair. I did enjoy the Spiced Apple Caramel Pie, it had a good balance of flavors. Overall, I'd give the dishes a 6 out of 10 for meeting basic expectations but not exceeding them. What do you all think?

[Vicky->all]: I'm with Nate on this one. The food at Stars & Stripes Diner was okay, but it didn't quite hit the spot for that comfort food craving I had. The Classic American Burger was decent, but I expected a bit more from the spices. The Spiced Apple Caramel Pie was probably the highlight for me too, but still, it was just fair. I think I'd also rate the overall meal at a 6 out of 10. It's a shame because I really wanted to enjoy it more. How about you, Steve? What's your take on the meal?

[Steve->all]: The dishes were satisfactory, but none stood out as particularly exciting or flavorful. The Patriot's Plant-Powered Burger was a decent healthier option, but it lacked the wow factor I was looking for. My dietary needs were met, but the overall experience could have been better. The United Flavors Salad was fine, but nothing to write home about. I'd say the meal met the basic requirements but didn't exceed any expectations. I'd give it a 6 out of 10 as well. Let's regroup for the final review.

[Nate->all]: It seems we're all on the same page with the Stars & Stripes Diner experience. The meal was fair across the board, with no standout dishes that impressed us. While the food met our basic expectations, it didn't deliver the bold and exciting flavors we were hoping for. It's disappointing when you're looking forward to a meal and it ends up being just average. However, I'm glad we tried something new and gave the diner a chance. Our scores are consistently aligned, so I feel ready to compile our final review. Shall we proceed with summarizing our thoughts?

[Vicky->all]: Yeah, let's go ahead and summarize our feedback. All of us seemed to find the meal at Stars & Stripes Diner to be just fair, with each dish not quite living up to our expectations. While I appreciate the effort to introduce bold flavors and healthier options, the execution didn't quite match the ambition. It was an average dining experience, and I think we all agree that it didn't surpass the standard set by our previous meals at American Flavors. Nate, since you initiated the conversation, do you want to draft our final review?
