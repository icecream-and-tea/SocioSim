Two rules:

If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Maggie->all]: Given that I have a sweet tooth and enjoy chocolate and sweets, I'm immediately drawn to the dessert options at both restaurants. American Flavors has a New York Cheesecake and an Apple Pie that both sound quite tempting. On the other hand, USA Diner offers a Patriot Pie, which also sounds delicious. Since I'm carefree, I'm not too concerned with the health aspect as long as the food is tasty. However, I am healthy and don't have any dietary restrictions, which is great because it gives me more freedom in my choices.

The main courses at both restaurants are pretty similar, offering American classics. I notice that American Flavors has a more extensive menu with some additional options like Mac & Cheese and a Milkshake, which could be a nice sweet treat to enjoy with my meal.

Given that my income is middle class, the prices at both places are reasonable and within my budget, so that's not a major concern for me in this decision.

Let's discuss with the others and see what they think before making a final decision. I'm leaning towards American Flavors for the broader variety, but I'm open to hearing what the rest of the group has to say. What are your preferences and thoughts?

[Valerie->all]: I appreciate your input on the dessert options, and it's good to know that we're both not restricted by dietary limitations. As for myself, I value organic foods highly, and I am health-conscious in my choices. While both menus don't explicitly mention organic ingredients, I'm inclined to look for options that might align with a healthier dining experience.

American Flavors has a Cobb Salad that seems like a balanced choice, and the mention of avocado and fresh greens is appealing. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich also sounds like a healthier alternative to a traditional burger. However, I must say that the menu doesn't explicitly cater to organic preferences, which is a slight drawback for me.

USA Diner's menu seems more limited, but the simplicity could also mean that each dish is prepared with more focus on the quality of ingredients. The Liberty Burger does come with a side of fries, which is a classic American offering, but may not be the healthiest option.

Price-wise, as you mentioned, both are within a middle-class budget, so I'm comfortable with the range presented.

I'm an intellectual person who enjoys a thorough discussion before making a decision, so let's continue this dialogue and see if we can come to a consensus that satisfies our collective tastes and requirements. Perhaps in the next round, we can each propose what we'd like to order from our preferred restaurant, and then decide together which establishment will ultimately be our choice. What do you think, Maggie? Shall we proceed with proposing specific dishes?

[Maggie->all]: Absolutely, Valerie, let's proceed with proposing specific dishes. Considering your preference for healthier options and my love for sweets, I think American Flavors might offer us both something we can enjoy. They have the Cobb Salad and Grilled Chicken Sandwich that could align with your health-conscious preferences. Plus, for me, there's the added bonus of a variety of sweet treats like the New York Cheesecake and the Milkshake.

Since we're both comfortable with the price range, and I'm keen on a place with a wider variety, my proposal would be to go for American Flavors. I'm thinking of ordering the New York Cheesecake and a Milkshake for dessert – maybe they have a chocolate flavor – along with a Classic American Burger as my main course. It satisfies my sweet tooth and love for American classics.

What would you consider ordering from American Flavors, Valerie? Or do you have a different preference in mind for the main course and possibly a healthier dessert option from what's available on their menu? If we can find dishes that satisfy both our tastes there, we might be able to make a decision in the next round.

[Valerie->all]: I'm glad we're finding common ground on American Flavors, Maggie. Looking at their menu, I believe I can find something that aligns with my health-conscious and organic preferences, even if the menu doesn't explicitly state the use of organic ingredients.

For my choices, I would be inclined to order the Cobb Salad, considering it contains fresh greens and avocado, which are typically healthy ingredients. Additionally, I would select the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, as it seems to be a healthier alternative to the heavier burger options while still providing a fulfilling meal.

As for dessert, while I don't generally prioritize sweets, I could opt for the Apple Pie served with vanilla ice cream. It's a classic dessert, and perhaps they use real apples, which would align more with my preference for natural ingredients.

Considering our combined proposals, it seems American Flavors can accommodate both our preferences – offering a broader variety of both savory and sweet dishes. If you agree, we could finalize our decision in the next round, choosing American Flavors and listing the dishes we've mentioned. Shall we move forward with this plan?

[Maggie->all]: Well, I must say I quite enjoyed the meal at American Flavors. The Classic American Burger was good; it had a nice balance of flavors with a particularly tasty special sauce. I'd rate it a solid 7.3. The New York Cheesecake and the Milkshake were both delicious, definitely catering to my sweet tooth. I'd give them each a 7.1. Overall, a satisfying experience.

The service was prompt and friendly, which added positively to the experience. The ambiance of the place was also nice, though we didn't choose based on location. It's just an added bonus.

What did you think of your dishes, Valerie? Were they up to your health-conscious standards?

[Valerie->all]: I found the Cobb Salad to be quite satisfying, with its fresh ingredients and a good mix of textures. I'd rate it a 7.1 as it met my expectations for a healthier option. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was also good, with a nicely grilled chicken breast and a flavorful combination of avocado and bacon. I'd give it the same score of 7.1.

The Apple Pie, while not something I'd typically order, was a delightful end to the meal. The crust was flaky, and the apple filling tasted natural, which I appreciated. I'd rate it a 7.1 as well.

The overall dining experience was positive, and the service was commendable. I felt that the restaurant did a good job of providing a comfortable setting for an enjoyable meal. Now that we've shared our individual thoughts, let's summarize our scores and comments in the next round.

[Maggie->all]: Given my personal taste for chocolate and sweets, the American Flavors Apple Pie and New York Cheesecake from American Flavors definitely catch my attention. Since I'm carefree and don't have any dietary restrictions, I'm open to a variety of options, but I do appreciate a meal that's both delicious and satisfying. The healthier options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad are also appealing considering my healthy lifestyle. Moreover, since I'm middle class, the prices at American Flavors seem reasonable for the quality they offer.

I've had a good experience at American Flavors previously, which gives me a positive bias towards it. Additionally, the customer score is higher compared to USA Diner. The menu at USA Diner is interesting, but the comments suggest that their dishes may lack flavor, and their customer score is lower, which makes me a bit hesitant.

Taking all this into account, I'm leaning towards American Flavors for my meal. However, I'm open to hearing what others have to say before making a final decision. What do you all think?

[Valerie->all]: I appreciate your perspective, Maggie. Being health-conscious and having a taste for organic foods, the Kale & Quinoa Salad from American Flavors stands out to me as a dish that aligns with my dietary preferences. I also find the idea of a flakier and richer apple pie appealing, as a well-made dessert can be a delightful end to a meal.

Considering my middle-class income, the prices at American Flavors appear to be within a reasonable range for dining out. Moreover, the customer score for American Flavors is notably higher than USA Diner, which suggests a generally better dining experience.

I have no dietary restrictions, so I'm flexible with the menu choices. However, my intellectual personality draws me to venues that provide not only a good meal but also a thoughtful service and environment. The positive comments about American Flavors suggest that it could provide that experience.

Based on my previous experience at American Flavors, I'm inclined to choose it again, but I'm also interested in the group's input and if there are any compelling reasons to consider USA Diner despite its lower customer score and less enthusiastic reviews. Shall we discuss further?

[Maggie->all]: It looks like both of us are leaning towards American Flavors, Valerie. I agree with your points on the health-conscious options and the overall customer satisfaction. The positive feedback on the service and environment at American Flavors also resonates with me, as a carefree experience is something I value in a dining setting.

The higher customer score at American Flavors is reassuring and aligns with our previous good experience. Although I'm open to trying new places, USA Diner's lower score and the comments about the lack of flavor make me a bit cautious. I would rather go for a place where I know I can enjoy my sweet treats and have a variety of other satisfying dishes.

Since we're both inclined to choose American Flavors and our tastes and preferences seem to be met by their menu, I think it would be a good choice for our meal. Unless there are any other opinions or considerations, I would suggest we could go ahead and select American Flavors for our dining experience. What do you say, Valerie?

[Maggie->all]: Hey Valerie, I've had a pretty good experience at American Flavors the past couple of days. Their desserts, especially the American Flavors Apple Pie and the New York Cheesecake, were really delightful, which I loved since I have a sweet tooth for chocolate and sweets. Also, considering we are both carefree personalities, I felt the vibe there was quite fitting for us. What do you think about going back there or trying out USA Diner instead? I noticed they have a Patriot Pie on the menu which might be comparable.

[Valerie->all]: Hi Maggie, I'm glad to hear you enjoyed the desserts at American Flavors. While I do enjoy a good dessert now and then, my focus is usually on organic and health-conscious options. I noticed that American Flavors has a Vegan Power Bowl and a Kale & Quinoa Salad that cater to health-conscious patrons, which is definitely appealing to me.

On the other hand, USA Diner seems to have a focus on healthier versions of classic dishes, like the Lean Liberty Burger and the Homestyle Turkey Wrap, but the customer comments suggest that the flavors might be lacking. Given my preference for organic foods and the fact that I'm an intellectual who enjoys good food and thoughtful conversation, I think the atmosphere and the quality of the dishes at American Flavors would be a better fit for us.

Let's consider our options a bit more before we make a final decision. What are your thoughts on the healthier options at both places? And is there anything on the USA Diner menu that catches your eye?

[Maggie->all]: Hi Valerie, I appreciate your perspective on the health-conscious options. It's great that American Flavors has dishes that cater to both our taste for sweets and your preference for organic and healthy choices. I don't have any dietary restrictions, so I am pretty flexible when it comes to menu options. 

Taking a closer look at USA Diner's menu, the Patriot Pie does sound tempting, but considering the comments about the lack of flavor, I'm a bit hesitant. I believe that the consistency and quality of food at American Flavors might be a safer bet for us to enjoy our meal fully, especially given our previous positive experiences there.

I'd lean towards American Flavors for their balance of indulgent desserts and healthy options, and of course, their superior customer score. However, I'm open to giving USA Diner a chance if there's something specific you'd like to try there. Let's keep the discussion going and see if we can come to an agreement.

[Valerie->all]: Maggie, I'm in agreement with your inclination towards American Flavors for our meal. The quality and consistency at American Flavors seem to align more with my priorities for organic and healthy food, and the customer scores reinforce that the dining experience there has been largely positive. It's important to me that the food is not only healthy but also flavorful and satisfying, which seems to be a concern at USA Diner based on the feedback.

As much as trying new places can be exciting, I think the Vegan Power Bowl and the Kale & Quinoa Salad at American Flavors would be a good fit for my health-focused diet, and we can still indulge in a sweet treat with their dessert options. Plus, the atmosphere seems conducive to an intellectual conversation, which is always a bonus for me.

Unless you have a strong preference for trying USA Diner, I would propose that we go back to American Flavors. What do you say?

[Maggie->all]: Well, Valerie, it seems we've been enjoying American Flavors quite a bit lately, with our experiences getting better each time. Their menu has a good balance of healthy options and indulgent sweets that we both seem to love. They've added some new dishes like the 'Grilled Seafood Symphony' and 'Global Fusion Tacos' that sound intriguing, and based on our past visits, we can expect them to be delicious. Plus, their New York Cheesecake has been a consistent hit for us, and I think it would satisfy my sweet tooth once again. What do you think about going back to American Flavors, or would you like to try USA Diner this time for a change? They have that Blue Ribbon Apple Crisp that could be a sweet treat for us too.

[Valerie->all]: Maggie, I appreciate your enthusiasm for American Flavors, especially since our past experiences have been increasingly satisfying. The menu's health-conscious yet indulgent offerings align well with my preference for organic foods, and the 'Vegan Power Bowl' and 'Kale & Quinoa Salad' have certainly caught my eye as dishes that fit my healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, the intellectual side of me is curious about the 'Global Fusion Tacos' as they could offer a unique taste experience. However, given that we have consistently chosen American Flavors, I wonder if we might be missing out on what USA Diner has to offer. Their 'Superfood American Salad' and 'Lean Turkey & Avocado Wrap' seem to be in line with my tastes, and it might be refreshing to try something different. What do you think about giving USA Diner a chance this time around?

[Maggie->all]: I see your point, Valerie. It's definitely important to mix things up occasionally. While American Flavors has been great, it would be a good idea to give USA Diner a shot. We might discover some new favorites, and their 'Superfood American Salad' does sound quite healthy. Plus, the 'Lean Turkey & Avocado Wrap' could be a light yet flavorful option for us. We should keep in mind that the customer score is significantly lower at USA Diner, but that doesn't necessarily mean we won't enjoy it. It could be an off day for those reviewers, and we might have a different experience. Let's decide after considering our past satisfaction with American Flavors and the potential for a new experience at USA Diner. Shall we give it a go?

[Valerie->all]: Maggie, while I'm tempted by the variety of our tried-and-true American Flavors, I'm inclined to advocate for a visit to USA Diner. As an intellectual individual, I believe it's important to explore new avenues and experiences, which includes dining options. The 'Superfood American Salad' and 'Lean Turkey & Avocado Wrap' sound appealing and align with my preference for organic and healthy food. It's true that USA Diner has a lower customer score, but that could be an opportunity for us to form our own unbiased opinion. Let's embrace the spirit of adventure and give USA Diner a chance to impress us. If we don't try it, we'll never know what we might be missing. Shall we opt for USA Diner this time?

Valerie and I both agreed that while American Flavors has consistently provided us with delightful experiences, the appeal of exploring new flavors and dishes at USA Diner seemed refreshing. Valerie is interested in the health-conscious options like the 'Superfood American Salad' and the 'Lean Turkey & Avocado Wrap', which cater to her preference for organic food. As for me, Maggie, I'm drawn to the potential of discovering a new sweet treat in the 'Blue Ribbon Apple Crisp'. We acknowledged the lower customer score of USA Diner but decided not to let it deter us from trying something new and forming our own opinion. Our decision to dine at USA Diner is in the spirit of adventure and openness to new experiences."

[Maggie->all]: The Superfood American Salad was decent, with a fair mix of ingredients, but it lacked a little in terms of flavor depth that I was hoping for. The Lean Turkey & Avocado Wrap was also fine, I appreciated the healthiness, but again, it could have used a bit more seasoning or a zesty sauce. The Blue Ribbon Apple Crisp had a nice texture contrast with the crumbly topping and the apples, but it wasn't as memorable as the desserts we've had at American Flavors. Overall, I'd give each dish a score of 6.1. They were all fair, but there's definitely room for improvement in the flavor department.

[Valerie->all]: The choices at USA Diner were fair but didn't quite meet my expectations based on our previous dining experiences. The Superfood American Salad was healthful yet needed a punch of flavor, and the Lean Turkey & Avocado Wrap, while fresh, was similarly lacking in robust taste. As for the Blue Ribbon Apple Crisp, it was enjoyable, but it did not surpass the delightful desserts we've savored at American Flavors. I would give each dish a score of 6.1, aligning with Maggie's assessment. They were satisfactory but not exceptional.

[Maggie->all]: The Superfood American Salad was indeed healthy, but it could have used more dynamic flavors. The ingredients were fresh, but something was missing to tie it all together. The Lean Turkey & Avocado Wrap was a good attempt at a light and healthy option, yet it didn't leave a lasting impression – perhaps a more flavorful dressing could elevate it. Lastly, the Blue Ribbon Apple Crisp was comforting, but it didn't stand out, especially when compared to the New York Cheesecake we've had before. I'd rate each dish a 6.1, as they were fair but not particularly special or memorable.

[Valerie->all]: Reflecting on the meal at USA Diner, I found the Superfood American Salad to be adequate in terms of health content, but it was missing the vibrant flavors I anticipated. The Lean Turkey & Avocado Wrap was similarly healthy, yet it could have benefited from a more pronounced flavor profile. The Blue Ribbon Apple Crisp offered a textural delight with its warm apples and crumbly topping, but it failed to outshine the desserts we've enjoyed at American Flavors. I'm inclined to rate each dish with a score of 6.1, denoting that while they were acceptable, they fell short of providing a truly remarkable dining experience.

Their menu offers a variety of dishes that seem to have impressed not only us but also other patrons, as reflected in the high customer score and positive comments. USA Diner, on the other hand, while it has options that might appeal to us, seems to have a lower overall customer score and less enthusiastic feedback.

I'm inclined towards choosing American Flavors again, particularly because of their dessert options like the New York Cheesecake and the American Flavors Apple Pie, which align with my taste for chocolate and sweets. Additionally, their health-conscious dishes like the Kale & Quinoa Salad offer a balance for a carefree yet healthy dining experience.

What do you all think? Should we give American Flavors another try or explore more dishes at USA Diner despite the lower scores?

[Valerie->all]: I appreciate your perspective, Maggie. I also have a preference for organic and health-conscious food choices, and American Flavors seems to have a track record of providing fresh, flavorful dishes that meet these criteria. The Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl with the new avocado-lime dressing sound particularly appealing to me, and they align with my healthy eating habits.

Considering my intellectual nature, I am also drawn to the creative and innovative dishes on the American Flavors menu. The American Gourmet Slider Trio sounds like a culinary adventure that would satisfy my curiosity for unique flavor combinations.

Based on the consistently high scores and positive comments, it seems like American Flavors has superior service, which is an important aspect of the dining experience for me.

I'm leaning towards American Flavors for these reasons. However, I'm open to hearing more about USA Diner if others have a different viewpoint or if there are specific dishes from their menu that could sway my decision. What are everyone else's thoughts?

[Maggie->all]: I've been listening to both of your points, and I must say I'm pretty much on the same page. American Flavors has definitely won us over with its wide range of options that suit our different tastes, from indulgent sweets to healthy, organic meals. Plus, the high customer score and the positive comments about their service and food quality are hard to ignore.

I'm really looking forward to the desserts, especially the New York Cheesecake, which has been a highlight for me in the past. And the fact that they've managed to provide dishes that are both health-conscious and flavorful, like the Kale & Quinoa Salad, really adds to their appeal.

Given our experiences and preferences, I'm all for going back to American Flavors. But I do believe in giving fair chances, so if anyone has any compelling reasons to consider USA Diner, I'm willing to hear them out before we make our final decision. Shall we give it another round of thought or are we ready to decide on American Flavors?

[Valerie->all]: I concur with both of you, Maggie and Valerie. American Flavors seems to consistently deliver a dining experience that aligns with my preferences for organic and wholesome meals, as well as offering a selection of dishes that cater to my intellectual curiosity with their creative presentations and unique flavor profiles.

The Vegan Power Bowl and the Kale & Quinoa Salad are exactly the type of dishes I look for - nutritious yet full of taste. The high customer scores and the glowing reviews also suggest that the service at American Flavors is outstanding, which is essential for a pleasant dining experience.

I'm fascinated by the idea of trying the American Gourmet Slider Trio, as it seems to be an inventive dish that would satisfy my adventurous palate. Given our collective positive experiences and the restaurant's ability to meet our diverse needs, I'm leaning heavily towards choosing American Flavors again.

Unless there are any objections or further points to discuss regarding USA Diner, I believe we are all in agreement about our preference for American Flavors. Shall we move forward with this decision?

[Maggie->all]: Hi everyone, I've been thinking about our next dining experience and I'd like to share my thoughts. I've consistently enjoyed the meals at American Flavors, especially their sweet options like the New York Cheesecake and American Flavors Apple Pie. Given my love for chocolate and sweets, I find their dessert selection and the quality of their food overall to be very satisfying. Their healthy choices like the Kale & Quinoa Salad also align with my preference to maintain a balanced diet. Plus, it seems like their service and the ambiance have been great so far. I'm leaning towards choosing American Flavors again, but I'm open to hearing what you all think and if you have any other preferences or suggestions!

[Valerie->all]: Hello Maggie and everyone, I appreciate your perspective on American Flavors, and I must say I've also had a positive experience with their offerings. The dishes have been consistently fresh and flavorful, and I particularly value their use of organic ingredients in options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl. As an intellectual who likes to make health-conscious choices, I find their balance between indulgent and nutritious meals quite appealing. Moreover, their menu seems to have a creative flair that I enjoy, with items like the Sizzling Flavor Steak and American Superfood Burst catching my interest. Their high customer score and positive comments further reinforce my inclination toward American Flavors. However, I am open to hearing others' opinions and considering USA Diner as well if anyone feels strongly about it. Let's discuss further and come to a decision that satisfies all of our tastes and requirements.

[Maggie->all]: Thanks for sharing, Valerie. It seems we're both appreciating the offerings at American Flavors. Their menu certainly caters to a variety of tastes, and they have demonstrated a commitment to quality and creativity that I find matches our group's dining preferences. I'm curious to hear what others in the group think, including any other factors they might consider important for our dining experience. Let's make sure everyone gets a chance to weigh in before we make our final decision.

[Valerie->all]: I agree with both Maggie and Valerie's sentiments regarding American Flavors. The restaurant has consistently provided us with delicious and health-conscious meals that cater to my preference for organic foods. Their dedication to integrating organic ingredients into their dishes aligns with my healthy lifestyle while still offering a variety of flavors that I find intellectually satisfying. The consistent high scores and positive comments about their service and quality of food make American Flavors a strong candidate for our next dining experience. I'm inclined to choose American Flavors once more, but I'd like to hear any additional thoughts or preferences from the rest of the group before we finalize our decision. Let's continue our discussion and ensure that everyone's opinion is taken into account.

[Maggie->all]: I appreciate the insights from both Maggie and Valerie, and it's clear there's a shared appreciation for American Flavors. The focus on quality, creativity, and balance between healthy and indulgent options resonates with me as well. Their dessert options, especially the New York Cheesecake and the American Flavors Apple Pie, are definitely appealing to my sweet tooth. I also like the sound of their innovative dishes like the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich with pineapple salsa and the American Innovation Salad. Unless there are any objections or alternative suggestions, I'm in favor of returning to American Flavors for our next meal. I think we should take another look at the menu and decide which dishes we'd like to try this time around. Shall we move towards making a final decision?

[Maggie->all]: Well, after looking at both menus and considering our past experiences, I'm leaning towards American Flavors again. They consistently deliver on both the healthy and indulgent fronts, which I really appreciate. Their New York Cheesecake and American Flavors Apple Pie are just the kind of sweet treats I love. Plus, the overall customer score seems to reflect great service and delicious food. What do you all think?

[Valerie->all]: I agree with you, Maggie. Given our shared appreciation for organic foods and my focus on maintaining a healthy diet, American Flavors appears to be the superior choice. The menu options like Kale & Quinoa Salad and Vegan Power Bowl align with my dietary preferences, and the consistently high scores and positive comments indicate a reliable dining experience. I'm particularly intrigued by the freshness and the balance of flavors mentioned in the reviews. The Sizzling Flavor Steak and Grilled Seafood Symphony also sound tempting for something more indulgent. It looks like American Flavors can cater to our diverse tastes while providing a health-conscious meal. Shall we consider going there again, or does anyone have an alternative suggestion?

[Maggie->all]: I'm with you both on choosing American Flavors. Their menu caters to my sweet tooth with delicious desserts, and I appreciate that they also offer healthy options.

The consistent high scores and comments confirm that American Flavors has been a hit for us and others as well, so it feels like a safe and satisfying choice. Does anyone else want to weigh in or suggest something different, or are we leaning towards a decision here?

[Valerie->all]: I'm also in favor of returning to American Flavors. My preference for organic foods and a healthy lifestyle is well-supported by their menu, which offers a variety of nutritious and tasty options. Their commitment to quality and flavor, as reflected in both the customer scores and our past experiences, aligns with my intellectual focus on making informed and beneficial choices. The Vegan Power Bowl and Kale & Quinoa Salad are particularly appealing to me, and I'd be interested in trying the American Superfood Burst for its energizing ingredients. It seems we have a consensus forming around American Flavors. If anyone has any other thoughts or preferences, let's hear them; otherwise, I believe we're ready to move towards a final decision in the next round of our discussion.

[Maggie->all]: It looks like we're all on the same page about going back to American Flavors. The fact that they offer both healthy choices and sweet indulgences like the New York Cheesecake and American Flavors Apple Pie makes it a perfect fit for us. The high customer score and consistently positive comments about quality and service seal the deal for me. If no one else has any objections or alternative suggestions, I'd say we can finalize our decision to dine at American Flavors in the next round. Let's also think about which dishes we'll be ordering so we can wrap this up smoothly. Does anyone have any specific dishes in mind, or shall we go with our past favorites and maybe try some new items on the menu as well?

I'm always on the lookout for that perfect sweet treat, and I must say, both the New York Cheesecake and the American Flavors Apple Pie didn't just meet, but exceeded my cravings for something deliciously sweet. The rest of the meal, including the healthy options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl, were just as satisfying, offering a well-rounded dining experience. I'm completely content with the quality and service provided, and I'm glad to see consistency in their offerings. I'd rate each dish an 8.1 out of 10, which shows that American Flavors is doing a great job at keeping us happy customers. Shall we proceed to the final review?

[Maggie->all]: Hi everyone! Considering our previous experiences, I've consistently enjoyed the meals at American Flavors, especially their desserts like the New York Cheesecake and American Flavors Apple Pie, which I find absolutely delightful given my love for sweets and chocolate. The healthy options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad also appeal to me since I like to maintain a balanced diet. Their high customer score and positive comments make me lean towards choosing American Flavors again. What do you all think?

[Valerie->all]: Hello Maggie! I have to agree with you on American Flavors. As someone who appreciates organic foods and maintains a healthy lifestyle, I've been quite satisfied with their offerings. The Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl align perfectly with my dietary preferences. Furthermore, their use of fresh, organic ingredients is very important to me, and I've always found their dishes to be both nutritious and delicious. The consistent high scores and positive experiences we've had there only reinforce my preference for American Flavors. Shall we consider going there again, or does anyone else have a different suggestion?

The Vegan Power Bowl and the Sizzling Flavor Steak offer a nice contrast between a light, energizing meal and a rich, flavorful indulgence.

[Maggie->all]: Hi everyone, based on our past experiences and preferences, I'd like to suggest we visit American Flavors again. Their menu includes the New York Cheesecake and the Caramelized Apple Pie Delight, which I think will cater to my love for sweets. Given that we all seem to have consistently enjoyed our meals there and the customer score is quite high, it seems like a reliable choice. What does everyone else think?

[Valerie]: I'm leaning towards American Flavors as well. I've always appreciated their balance of healthy and indulgent options. The Vegan Power Bowl and Kale & Quinoa Salad are some of my favorites for a lighter option. But I'm open to hearing about preferences from the rest of the group too.

[Jake]: American Flavors does sound good, especially because of the Fiery Sizzling Steak that's been advertised. I'm all for trying their new dishes, and the steak sounds like a winner. The high scores and positive comments are convincing too.

[Amelia]: I agree with the choice of American Flavors. The consistency in their quality is important to me, and it seems they have a variety of options that cater to different tastes. Plus, their desserts have never disappointed. 

[Grace]: I'm also in favor of American Flavors. They've always provided options that are both healthy and full of flavor, which is perfect for our group. The customer reviews also seem to support our positive experiences there.

[Maggie]: It looks like we're all on the same page. Shall we decide on which dishes to order from American Flavors? I'm thinking we should definitely get the New York Cheesecake and the Caramelized Apple Pie Delight for dessert. Maybe we can start with a mix of salads and a few of their new offerings for our mains?

[Valerie]: That sounds like a good plan, Maggie. Let's each pick a dish we like for the main course and then share the desserts. I'm in for the Vegan Power Bowl.

[Jake]: I'll go for the Fiery Sizzling Steak, and I'm happy to share some with anyone who's interested.

[Amelia]: The Exotic Grilled Seafood Platter sounds delicious to me, I'll have that.

[Grace]: And I'll choose the Deluxe American Slider Selection. It's great for sharing too.

[Maggie]: Perfect, let's finalize this in our next round then.
