[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.

[Olivia->all]: Based on the information provided for both "American Flavors" and "USA Diner," I would like to start the first round of our discussion by expressing my preferences and needs.

Given my affluent income, I am looking for a dining experience that offers not only good food but also a pleasant atmosphere and high-quality service. My taste leans towards Mediterranean cuisine, so I tend to prefer dishes with fresh ingredients, such as salads, grilled meats, and seafood, with an emphasis on flavorful herbs and spices.

I must emphasize that I have allergies and require a gluten-free diet, which is a critical factor in my decision-making process. Therefore, it is essential that the restaurant we choose can accommodate this dietary restriction and ensure that my meal is safe for consumption.

Considering my artistic personality, I appreciate creativity and originality in the presentation and flavor profiles of the dishes. A restaurant that offers unique dining experiences or has an artistic flair to its dishes and decor would be particularly appealing to me.

From a preliminary look at the menus, "American Flavors" seems to have more variety, including a Cobb Salad, which could potentially be adapted to be gluten-free, and a grilled chicken sandwich that may also be modified if they can provide a gluten-free bread option. "USA Diner" has a more limited selection, and their menu items seem to be more traditional American fare with fewer options that could be easily adapted to a gluten-free diet.

I would like to hear the opinions and needs of the other members before proposing a final decision.

[Charlie->all]: Reflecting on the options between "American Flavors" and "USA Diner," I'd like to share my perspective for our first round of discussion.

With my taste preferences geared towards sandwiches and salads, I'm naturally inclined towards options that offer a variety of these. Health is also a priority for me, so I look for dishes that are not only tasty but also provide nutritional value. Being quite picky, the quality of the ingredients and the care put into the preparation of the food are significant factors in my dining choice.

Financially, I am well-off, so price is not my primary concern; instead, the overall dining experience and food quality take precedence. Having no dietary restrictions gives me the flexibility to choose from a full range of menu items.

Upon reviewing the menus, "American Flavors" seems to have a broader selection that aligns with my tastes, specifically the "Cobb Salad" and the "Grilled Chicken Sandwich." These dishes appear to be both health-conscious and within my preferred food category. In contrast, "USA Diner" seems to have a more limited offering, with the "Liberty Burger" being the closest to my preference, though it might not meet my health criteria as well as the options at "American Flavors."

I also notice that "American Flavors" has a loyalty program, which could enhance the dining experience with potential discounts and themed events, perhaps adding to the service quality that I value.

I am open to hearing what others in the group have to say and am looking forward to reaching a consensus that accommodates everyone's needs and preferences.

[Olivia->all]: I appreciate both of your insights, Charlie and Olivia. As we continue this discussion, it's important to consider everyone's preferences and requirements. I am also looking for a satisfying dining experience that provides a good value for money, even though I don't have any specific dietary restrictions.

From what Olivia has shared, it seems essential that the restaurant we choose is able to cater to a gluten-free diet, due to her allergies. Moreover, her preference for Mediterranean cuisine should be taken into account, even though the options we have are American-themed restaurants. The creativity and presentation of the dishes are also important to Olivia, which I believe should be reflected in our final choice.

Charlie's preference for nutritious options like salads and sandwiches is well-noted. It appears that "American Flavors" could be a good fit for both Charlie and Olivia, with its variety and potential for customization to meet dietary needs.

Looking at the menus, I personally find "American Flavors" to have a more appealing selection, with the possibility of a more customized experience through their loyalty program. The "Cobb Salad" and "Grilled Chicken Sandwich" could be promising choices for our group, possibly adapted to be gluten-free for Olivia.

Based on our current discussion, I am leaning towards "American Flavors" as it seems to better accommodate the group's diverse preferences and dietary requirements. However, I am open to further input and would like to reach a decision that everyone is comfortable with. Shall we consider "American Flavors" as our choice, perhaps focusing on their customizable options to ensure Olivia's gluten-free needs are met? Let's discuss further and aim to come to a preliminary agreement.

[Charlie->all]: I've listened to the input from both Olivia and our other dining companion, and I think we're forming a consensus that "American Flavors" might be the best option for our group. It's important that we choose a place that can accommodate Olivia's need for a gluten-free meal and also offer a selection that aligns with my preference for sandwiches and salads.

Considering the menu options, "American Flavors" offers a diversity that seems to cater well to our collective preferences. The "Cobb Salad" and "Grilled Chicken Sandwich" are dishes that I find particularly appealing and believe they could be prepared to meet health-conscious criteria. Additionally, the loyalty program and themed events mentioned in the advertisement suggest a level of service and dining experience that I value.

Given that none of us have mentioned any budget constraints, I would propose that we focus more on the quality and suitability of the food rather than the cost. I agree with the suggestion to choose "American Flavors," provided they can ensure a gluten-free adaptation of their dishes for Olivia. If we all agree on this, we could move forward and make this our choice in the next round of our discussion. 

Are we all in agreement to choose "American Flavors," and shall we start considering which specific dishes to order to ensure we have enough variety and meet everyone's needs?

The Apple Pie was delightful and a nice sweet treat to end the meal. Lastly, the Sweet Potato Fries were a great gluten-free side, crispy and well-seasoned.

[Olivia->all]: Given my previous experience at American Flavors, where I found the dishes to be both health-conscious and satisfying to my gluten-free needs, I am leaning towards dining there again. The improved classic American apple pie and the kale & quinoa salad would be my preferred choices, as they align with my artistic personality, which appreciates the creative twist on the classics, and my preference for Mediterranean cuisine due to the use of fresh ingredients in the salad.

However, I am open to considering USA Diner since they offer a "Gluten-Free Gastronomy Pizza," which could be a delightful choice that fits my dietary restrictions. I would like to hear other members' thoughts and experiences, particularly regarding the taste and quality of the gluten-free options at USA Diner, as the comments suggest there might be room for improvement in flavor. If others have had positive experiences with the taste of USA Diner's offerings, I might be persuaded to try something new. Let's discuss and reach a decision together.

[Charlie->all]: Given that I have a healthy income, I enjoy sandwiches and salads, and I'm in good health with no dietary restrictions, I would be inclined to go with American Flavors. My picky nature leads me to prefer restaurants that can offer a consistently good experience, and based on our previous visit, American Flavors seems to fit the bill with a customer score that reflects satisfaction among diners. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Cobb Salad seem like they would be right up my alley, particularly since they cater to my taste for sandwiches and salads. 

I do appreciate the option of the Vegetarian Victory Bowl at USA Diner, which sounds healthy and delicious, but the overall lower customer score and comments about a lack of flavor from USA Diner make me hesitant. I'd like to hear more from the others to see if they have had better experiences at USA Diner or if they also prefer the menu options and the known quality of American Flavors. Let's continue the discussion to make sure we're making a choice that satisfies everyone's needs and preferences.

[Olivia->all]: Given our previous experiences and preferences, I'm still inclined towards American Flavors. Their menu items, specifically the Kale & Quinoa Salad, align with my Mediterranean taste preferences, and they have previously accommodated my gluten-free needs. The overall customer score is higher at American Flavors, and the consistent quality noted in the comments is reassuring.

While USA Diner has a gluten-free pizza option, the feedback concerning their lack of flavor is a concern. I am looking for a meal that is not only safe for my allergies but also enjoyable and flavorful. Unless someone can vouch for a marked improvement in USA Diner's flavor profiles since the last reviews, I would prefer we stick with American Flavors for a more guaranteed pleasing experience. Shall we proceed with American Flavors, or does anyone have a compelling argument for USA Diner that we should consider?

[Charlie->all]: Considering our previous experiences and current preferences, I'm also leaning towards American Flavors. Their Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Cobb Salad align perfectly with my love for sandwiches and salads, and given my picky nature, I'm looking for consistency in quality and taste, which American Flavors seems to provide. The higher customer score is indicative of a better dining experience for the majority of patrons.

While I'm open to exploring new options, the feedback on USA Diner points towards an average experience with some concerns about the flavor, which might not satisfy my discerning taste. I haven't seen anything particularly compelling in the comments that would sway me towards USA Diner over American Flavors.

If no one has strong opinions in favor of USA Diner or can provide recent, positive feedback that might sway our decision, I would suggest we stick with American Flavors for this meal. Are we ready to make a decision, or is there more to discuss?

[Olivia->all]: Given my preferences for Mediterranean cuisine and the need for gluten-free options due to my allergies, I'm leaning more towards American Flavors today. Their Vegan Power Bowl and Kale & Quinoa Salad seem to be in line with both my health requirements and taste preferences. The consistent high scores and positive comments about their dishes catering to health-conscious patrons also make me confident in their service and food quality. Plus, as someone with an artistic personality, the improved presentation and innovation mentioned in the advertisement appeal to me. What do you all think?

[Charlie]: I noticed that USA Diner's customer score is significantly lower, and the comments point towards their dishes lacking flavor. Even though they have gluten-free options, if they aren't well-seasoned or creative, it might not be the best choice for our group. I'm also in favor of American Flavors, considering they seem to offer a more consistent and flavorful experience. Shall we give American Flavors another try and perhaps explore different dishes on their menu?

[Charlie->all]: I agree with both Olivia and Charlie. American Flavors has a higher customer score and the comments reflect a positive dining experience, with particular emphasis on the consistency and quality of the food. Given my preference for sandwiches and salads, and the fact that I'm quite picky when it comes to food, American Flavors seems like the better choice. Their menu has options that cater to my tastes, such as the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Kale & Quinoa Salad. Furthermore, their commitment to freshness aligns with my health-conscious lifestyle. Unless anyone has any objections or alternative suggestions, I propose we choose American Flavors for our meal today.

[Olivia->all]: I appreciate everyone’s input and it seems we're all in agreement. American Flavors has options that satisfy our group's diverse preferences while still adhering to my gluten-free dietary needs. With the positive feedback on their consistent quality and flavorful dishes, I'm happy to go with American Flavors again. Since we're looking to try different dishes, I'm interested in the Vegan Power Bowl and the Kale & Quinoa Salad for their fresh and health-conscious ingredients. Plus, they sound delightfully Mediterranean-inspired. If we’re ready to make a decision, I can go ahead and propose our final order in the next round. Shall we finalize on American Flavors then?

[Olivia->all]: I've had consistently good experiences at American Flavors, particularly with their Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Kale & Quinoa Salad. Their menu items seem to cater well to my gluten-free dietary needs, and I also appreciate their focus on fresh and flavorful ingredients that align with my health-conscious lifestyle. Given my affinity for Mediterranean cuisine, I find the flavors at American Flavors to be more aligned with my tastes, even though it's not strictly Mediterranean. I suggest we consider going back to American Flavors, but I'd like to hear your thoughts and preferences as well.

[Charlie->all]: I appreciate your input, Olivia. I'm inclined to agree with you regarding American Flavors. My personal experiences there have been quite positive as well, particularly when it comes to their Grilled Chicken Sandwich and salads, which perfectly fit my preference for sandwiches and salads. The freshness and health aspects they offer are right up my alley, and as someone who's picky about food, I find American Flavors meets my standards for taste and quality consistently. USA Diner, while it has some appealing options, seems to have received mixed reviews regarding flavor, and taste is a big deal for me. Let's keep the discussion going and see if we can come to a decision that satisfies us both.

[Olivia->all]: Given our shared positive experiences and your preference for dishes that align with a health-conscious and gluten-free diet, I think American Flavors is the better choice for us. The menu offers a variety of options that cater to our dietary needs, and the quality of the food has been consistently high in our past visits. USA Diner seems to have more mixed reviews, and while they do offer some healthy choices, the feedback suggests that their flavors might not be as satisfying. Since taste and quality are important to both of us, I believe American Flavors will provide us with a better dining experience once again. Shall we consider finalizing our decision in favor of American Flavors, or is there anything else we should take into account?

[Charlie->all]: I completely agree, Olivia. Our experiences at American Flavors have been great, and the consistency in the quality of their food is a big plus for me. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Kale & Quinoa Salad seem like excellent choices that fit both our preferences. I'm also curious to try their new weekly special, the 'Sizzling Flavor Steak,' as it sounds like a delightful addition to their menu. I think we're on the same page here, and unless you have any further considerations, I'm ready to move towards finalizing our decision to dine at American Flavors once again. Shall we proceed with this plan?

[Olivia->all]: Based on our previous experiences and the information provided, I lean towards returning to American Flavors. They've consistently met our gluten-free and health-conscious needs while delivering flavorful dishes. Their Kale & Quinoa Salad and Grilled Chicken Sandwich were both delicious and suitable for my dietary restrictions. Additionally, their focus on fresh ingredients aligns with my artistic appreciation for quality and presentation. What does everyone else think?

[Charlie->all]: I'm inclined to agree with you, Olivia. My experiences at American Flavors have been quite positive, and the menu options like the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Kale & Quinoa Salad are right up my alley, given my preference for sandwiches and salads. The consistent quality and focus on health are important to me, and I am particularly picky about the freshness of the ingredients. I feel American Flavors has demonstrated their capability to provide this consistently. Shall we consider going there again or does someone have a different perspective or suggestion?

[Olivia->all]: I do see the appeal of American Flavors given our past experiences. Their menu items like the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Kale & Quinoa Salad fit well with Olivia and Charlie's preferences and dietary needs. However, I'm curious about the new options at USA Diner, such as the Lean Turkey & Hummus Wrap, which could be a great gluten-free choice, and the Health-Boost American Salad for a health-conscious choice. I think it's worth considering, especially since we have been to American Flavors several times already. Might it be time for a change, or should we stick with what we know is good? What do you all think?

[Charlie->all]: Given that I have a preference for sandwiches and salads and a taste for fresh, high-quality ingredients, I'm still leaning towards American Flavors. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Kale & Quinoa Salad have been consistent favorites of mine, and the restaurant has proven to meet my picky standards. While USA Diner does offer some appealing dishes like the Lean Turkey & Hummus Wrap and the Health-Boost American Salad, the overall customer score is significantly lower than that of American Flavors. Given my affluent income, the slightly higher prices at American Flavors are not a deterrent for me. I think we should stick with American Flavors, where we know the quality and taste meet our expectations. What's the final verdict from the group? Shall we go for American Flavors again?

[Olivia->all]: I appreciate everyone's input. While USA Diner has some tempting new dishes, the consistently high scores and positive experiences at American Flavors make it a more reliable choice for us. Their commitment to accommodating gluten-free options and fresh ingredients is important to me. With my artistic leanings, the quality of the ingredients and the presentation of the dishes are essential, and American Flavors has excelled in these areas. The Sizzling Flavor Steak also sounds like a delightful option to try this time, along with our previous favorites. So, unless there are any other considerations, I would propose we dine at American Flavors again. Can we all agree on this?

Both Olivia and I favor the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Kale & Quinoa Salad, which are in line with my preference for sandwiches and salads. Olivia also expressed interest in trying the Sizzling Flavor Steak, which offers a new taste experience while maintaining the quality we've come to expect. Although there was some interest in the new options at USA Diner, the overall lower customer scores compared to American Flavors suggest that American Flavors is the more reliable choice for our dining experience. My picky nature and affluent income support the decision to go for the higher-scoring restaurant, ensuring a meal that meets my standards for delicious food and superior service."

[Olivia->all]: Based on our previous experiences, American Flavors has consistently met our expectations with high-quality, delicious, and health-conscious dishes. Their menu offers a variety of options that cater to our gluten-free needs, and the introduction of new dishes like the 'American Spice Delight' and 'Heartland Harvest Bowl' keeps the dining experience exciting and varied. I'm inclined towards the freshness and the Mediterranean-inspired options like the 'Kale & Quinoa Salad'.

[Charlie]: What do you think about trying USA Diner today? They have a 'Superfood American Salad' which seems to align with our health preferences, and their 'Ultimate Patriot Pie' has a rich buttery crust that could be a delightful change. Plus, they are offering a discount for first-time customers, which could be advantageous.

[Charlie->all]: I appreciate your thoughts, Olivia. While the 'Superfood American Salad' at USA Diner does catch my eye for its healthful ingredients, I can't help but notice that American Flavors seems to have a more consistently high rating from both our past experiences and other customers' reviews. The 'Kale & Quinoa Salad' and 'Sizzling Flavor Steak' have been standout dishes for me, and I think their 'Heartland Harvest Bowl' could be a great new dish to try. Given our picky palates and the importance of quality and flavor, I'm leaning towards choosing American Flavors again. What are your thoughts on sticking with a restaurant that has proven to deliver satisfaction?

[Olivia->all]: I hear you, Charlie, and I definitely see the appeal in trying something new at USA Diner, especially with the promise of a discount for first-time customers. However, considering the consistent quality and satisfaction we've had at American Flavors, along with their diverse menu that caters to our gluten-free and health-conscious needs, I'm also leaning towards returning there. The 'Kale & Quinoa Salad' has been a favorite of mine, and I'm eager to try their 'Heartland Harvest Bowl' which seems to align with my preference for Mediterranean flavors. Furthermore, the customer scores and comments suggest that American Flavors maintains a higher standard, which is important to me. Unless there's a compelling reason to switch, my vote would be to go with American Flavors for another enjoyable dining experience. Shall we decide on the dishes to order in the next round of discussion?

[Charlie->all]: Given our past positive experiences at American Flavors and the consistently high ratings from other patrons, I'm inclined to agree that we should dine there again. Their offerings, particularly the 'Kale & Quinoa Salad' and the new 'Heartland Harvest Bowl', seem to perfectly match our taste for sandwiches and salads, as well as our health-conscious approach. Although USA Diner's 'Superfood American Salad' and the discount for first-time customers are attractive, the overall customer satisfaction and our own previous high scores for American Flavors make it a more reliable choice for us. I'd be happy to go with American Flavors again and explore more of their menu. Let's make our final decision in the next round. Shall we?

[Olivia->all]: Given my preference for Mediterranean flavors and the need for gluten-free options, I've consistently had a great experience at American Flavors. Their Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl have been particularly satisfying, aligning with my health-conscious and artistic tastes. Also, their customer score is significantly higher than USA Diner's. What is everyone else thinking?

[Charlie->all]: I've noticed that American Flavors has a good selection of dishes that I enjoy, such as salads and sandwiches, which align with my healthy eating habits. I've previously had very positive experiences there, with the food being fresh and well-prepared, catering to my picky nature. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Kale & Quinoa Salad have been consistent favorites. While I'm always open to trying new places, the lower customer score and the comments about USA Diner suggest that their flavors might not be as bold or consistent as American Flavors. I'm leaning towards returning to American Flavors, but I'm curious to hear more from the group.

[Olivia->all]: I appreciate your input, Charlie. It seems that we're both inclined towards American Flavors based on our previous positive experiences. The dishes there have not only been consistently good but also cater to my dietary restrictions while satisfying my Mediterranean taste preference. The higher customer score and positive comments further reinforce this choice for me. If there are no strong preferences for USA Diner or specific dishes from there, I'd suggest we stick with American Flavors. Does anyone else have thoughts or preferences they'd like to share?

[Charlie->all]: I agree with both of you, Olivia and Charlie. American Flavors has continuously met our expectations with their fresh and flavorful dishes, and they do offer a variety of salads and sandwiches that fit my taste and health requirements. The consistently high scores and positive comments about their meals, especially the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Kale & Quinoa Salad, which I personally enjoyed, assure me that we can expect a satisfying dining experience there. Plus, their menu has a wide selection without any dietary restrictions for me to worry about. I don't see any compelling reason to switch to USA Diner given the lower customer scores and less enthusiastic comments. I'm also in favor of choosing American Flavors again for our meal. Shall we proceed with this choice and discuss which dishes to order?

[Olivia->all]: I'm glad we're all on the same page regarding our preference for American Flavors. Given our past experiences and the menu offerings that cater to our health-conscious choices and dietary needs, it seems like the best option for us. I'd like to propose that we finalize our decision to dine at American Flavors and select dishes that reflect our shared preferences for fresh, flavorful, and healthful meals. If everyone is in agreement, we can move forward to the next step and pick our dishes. Charlie, would you like to start the selection process based on your favorites, or shall we consider the new menu items as well?

The American Flavors Apple Pie was a real treat to finish the meal – the apples were perfectly spiced, and the crust was just the right kind of flaky. I'll give it an 8.5 because while I enjoyed it, I have a slight preference for less sweet desserts. American Flavors lived up to my expectations once again with their fresh and high-quality offerings.

[Olivia->all]: Good evening everyone! Reflecting on our previous dining experiences, I've consistently enjoyed the meals at American Flavors. Their menu offers a variety of gluten-free options which is crucial for my dietary needs. The Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich were particularly delightful. As I have an affinity for Mediterranean cuisine, I noticed they've enhanced their salad with roasted Mediterranean vegetables. Their customer score is also quite high, and the comments we've seen so far are very positive. Shall we consider giving American Flavors another visit today? What are your thoughts?

[Charlie->all]: Hi Olivia! I'm glad to hear you've been enjoying American Flavors. I must say, my experiences there have been quite satisfactory as well. Their sandwiches and salads, which are my favorites, have been consistently fresh and delicious. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Kale & Quinoa Salad you mentioned are certainly appealing to my tastes. Given our health-conscious approach, it's great to see a menu that offers both flavorful and healthy options. Additionally, their high customer score and positive feedback are encouraging. I'm leaning towards returning to American Flavors, but I'm open to hearing what the others have to say before we make a final decision. What are your preferences for today's meal?

[Olivia->all]: I appreciate your thoughts, Charlie! It seems we're on the same page regarding American Flavors. Their focus on fresh ingredients and the ability to cater to specific dietary needs like gluten-free options align well with our preferences. Plus, the creativity in their dishes, like the American Gourmet Slider Trio, appeals to my artistic side. I'm curious to see if others in the group have had similar positive experiences or if they would like to explore USA Diner for variety. However, I do have a slight concern about USA Diner's lower customer score and some of the comments mentioning the dishes lacked flavor. It's important for me that the meal is not only healthy but also rich in taste, so I'm still leaning towards American Flavors. Let's check in with the rest of the group for their input.

[Charlie->all]: Indeed, Olivia, the idea of having another meal at American Flavors is quite appealing to me. Their commitment to freshness and flavorful dishes matches my picky nature, and since I've enjoyed their sandwiches and salads on multiple occasions, I am quite inclined to stick with what has proven to be a delightful experience. The consistent high scores and positive comments do provide a compelling reason to return. However, I am open to the group's consensus and would like to hear from others as well before we conclude. Shall we gather everyone's thoughts and see if there's an interest in trying something different or sticking to the tried and true?

[Olivia->all]: I think it's great that we both have enjoyed American Flavors and find their offerings align with our dietary needs and taste preferences. Since we're considering returning, I would suggest we try some of their other dishes as well to keep our dining experience exciting. Perhaps we could try the American Gourmet Slider Trio for a bit of variety, alongside the Kale & Quinoa Salad which is a proven favorite for us. I'm still a bit hesitant about USA Diner due to the lower customer ratings and comments about the lack of flavor, which is something very important for my dining experience. Let's wait for feedback from the rest of the group to see if they share our views or have different preferences that we should consider.

[Charlie->all]: Thank you, Olivia, for summarizing the considerations. I agree that American Flavors seems to be the better option for us, especially since we both value fresh, flavorful dishes. Your suggestion to include the American Gourmet Slider Trio in our order is a good idea, as it would allow us to explore new flavors while still enjoying our favorites, like the Kale & Quinoa Salad. I'm also pleased with the previous experiences we've had at American Flavors, and I believe that consistency is key when it comes to dining out. Given that the feedback for USA Diner has been less favorable, I feel more confident in choosing American Flavors once again. Unless anyone has any objections or alternative suggestions, I think we're ready to proceed with American Flavors for our meal today. Shall we go ahead and finalize our decision?

[Olivia->all]: Given my preference for Mediterranean cuisine and the need for gluten-free options due to my allergies, I would lean towards American Flavors, which has consistently provided dishes that align with my dietary restrictions and taste preferences. Their Kale & Quinoa Salad, which is now enhanced with roasted Mediterranean vegetables, and the American Superfood Burst seem particularly appealing and suitable for my artistic personality, as they offer creativity in their presentation and flavors.

Charlie, how do you feel about the options? American Flavors has been our go-to, but I know you appreciate variety. Do you think we should give USA Diner another chance, or should we stick with what has been working for us? Their Heartland Harvest Bowl could be a good health-conscious choice, but I'm not sure about their gluten-free offerings. What are your thoughts?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I appreciate your input and I understand your dietary needs. Looking at our past experiences, American Flavors does seem to have a strong track record with us, especially considering their fresh ingredients and bold flavors, which I'm quite fond of. I also have a penchant for sandwiches and salads, and it looks like the American Flavors menu caters well to those tastes, particularly with options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the American Gourmet Slider Trio.

While I am always open to exploring new places, the customer score and comments for USA Diner suggest that it might not meet our standards for delicious food and superior service. The Heartland Harvest Bowl does catch my eye as a health-conscious choice, but given the overall feedback, I'm leaning towards sticking with American Flavors for now. I think they offer a better guarantee for a satisfying meal.

However, I am open to considering USA Diner if you feel strongly about trying something different today. What are your thoughts on giving USA Diner a chance, or shall we continue with our favorite, American Flavors?

[Olivia->all]: Charlie, I appreciate your openness and consideration of our dining history. I think it's important we stay true to our taste and dietary needs, and American Flavors seems to consistently hit the mark for us. The customer scores and our own experiences suggest that we are more likely to enjoy our meal at American Flavors, as opposed to taking a gamble with USA Diner, whose offerings might not fully accommodate my gluten-free requirement or match our taste for Mediterranean-inspired cuisine.

Given that we both enjoy the salads and sandwiches at American Flavors, and they have a variety of options that cater to our health-conscious approach, I suggest we stick with American Flavors for today's meal. We know they provide superior service and delicious food that aligns with our preferences. Plus, their ability to provide consistent quality is something we've both come to appreciate.

Unless you have any further thoughts or a strong desire to try USA Diner today, I think we can move towards making a final decision. Shall we go for another enjoyable meal at American Flavors?

[Charlie->all]: Olivia, I agree with your points. Given our past positive experiences and the consistently high scores we've given American Flavors, I feel confident in choosing them again for our meal. The Kale & Quinoa Salad and the American Gourmet Slider Trio are exactly the kinds of dishes I enjoy, and they seem to align perfectly with our preferences for healthy, flavorful food.

I have no strong desire to switch to USA Diner today, especially since American Flavors seems to offer a more reliable experience based on our past dining experiences and their menu options. Let's go ahead and finalize our decision to dine at American Flavors. Shall we proceed with selecting our dishes?

[Olivia->all]: The Kale & Quinoa Salad was as delightful as expected, with the roasted Mediterranean vegetables being a highlight. The American Gourmet Slider Trio was creatively presented and each slider had its own distinct, delicious flavor. The American Superfood Burst felt energizing and the ingredients were incredibly fresh. The Sizzling Flavor Steak was cooked to perfection, and the Grilled Seafood Symphony was a harmonious blend of seafood and spices. Each dish was a testament to American Flavors' commitment to quality and taste. I would give a 9 for the overall experience today.

Charlie, how did you find the meal today? I thought the flavors were robust and the dishes were well-executed. What are your thoughts and scores for the individual dishes?

[Charlie->all]: The dishes today at American Flavors were exceptional. The Kale & Quinoa Salad was refreshing, with the perfect mix of textures and the dressing was spot on. The American Gourmet Slider Trio was a standout, offering an excellent variety of flavors, and each slider was cooked just right. The American Superfood Burst was not only nutritious but also packed with flavor. The Sizzling Flavor Steak was succulent and the seasoning brought out the natural flavors of the meat. Lastly, the Grilled Seafood Symphony was a delightful dish that showcased the freshness of the seafood. I'm thoroughly impressed and would rate our overall dining experience with a 9 out of 10.

[Olivia->all]: As a member of our dining group with an affinity for Mediterranean cuisine and a requirement for gluten-free options due to my health and dietary restrictions, I've reviewed the information provided for both "American Flavors" and "USA Diner." Given my artistic personality, I am drawn to dishes that are not only health-conscious but also creative and beautifully presented.

Reflecting on our past experiences, "American Flavors" has consistently delivered dishes that cater to our needs and tastes, especially with options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad enhanced with roasted Mediterranean vegetables. The American Gourmet Slider Trio also seems to offer a good balance of flavors and variety which could satisfy our palates.

While "USA Diner" has some appealing options, such as the Superfood American Salad and the Heartland Harvest Bowl, the overall customer score and comments suggest that it might not meet our expectations in terms of flavor and creativity compared to "American Flavors."

I am leaning toward returning to "American Flavors" for our next meal. However, I am open to hearing everyone's input and preferences before we make a final decision. Charlie, what are your thoughts on this?

[Charlie->all]: Based on our previous experiences and my personal preferences, I concur with the inclination towards "American Flavors." My taste for sandwiches and salads aligns well with their offerings, particularly the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Kale & Quinoa Salad, which have received consistent praise in our recent visits. The freshness and flavor profiles described align with my preference for delicious food, and my picky nature is comforted by our group's consistently high individual scores for "American Flavors."

Moreover, my healthy lifestyle is not compromised as "American Flavors" has a range of health-conscious dishes on their menu. No dietary restrictions challenge me, allowing for a broader selection. The Vegan Power Bowl and the American Superfood Burst could be interesting additions to try, maintaining the health aspect of my diet.

While the "USA Diner" presents heartier traditional options, the lower customer score and less enthusiastic comments suggest a possible disparity in food quality and service that may not live up to our group's established standards.

In summary, while I'm open to discussion and will consider other opinions, my vote leans heavily towards another visit to "American Flavors." Shall we discuss this further or is there a consensus forming already?

[Olivia->all]: I appreciate your insights, Charlie. It seems we are on the same page regarding "American Flavors." Their menu options have not only been consistently good but also align with our dietary needs and taste preferences. The quality of their dishes, especially those that we've enjoyed in the past like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, make "American Flavors" a strong contender.

However, I do think we should consider trying something new from their menu to keep our dining experience fresh and exciting. Perhaps we can look at the Vegan Power Bowl or the Sizzling Flavor Steak as new dishes to try, ensuring we cater to both our health-conscious approach and our desire for flavorful meals.

Before we make a final decision, I'd like to hear from others in our group as well to ensure we're all looking forward to the dining experience and that everyone's preferences are considered. What do the rest of you think? Are there any dishes at "USA Diner" that particularly appeal to anyone, or do we all agree that "American Flavors" is the way to go once again?

[Charlie->all]: I agree with both Olivia and Charlie's assessments. "American Flavors" has proven to offer a selection that accommodates my preference for sandwiches and salads, and their emphasis on fresh and health-conscious meals aligns with my healthy lifestyle. The customer scores and comments also indicate that "American Flavors" has a track record of satisfying our group's expectations, which is important to me as a picky eater who values delicious food and superior service.

Given our past positive experiences at "American Flavors," I am not inclined to switch to "USA Diner," especially considering its lower customer score and less favorable comments. While I appreciate the variety, the consistency and quality at "American Flavors" make it a more reliable choice for our dining experience.

As for the menu, I would be interested in ordering the Kale & Quinoa Salad for its health benefits, the American Gourmet Slider Trio for a taste of variety, and perhaps the American Superfood Burst to try something new yet within my taste preferences.

I believe we are forming a consensus towards "American Flavors," but I am also open to hearing any counterarguments or different opinions before we finalize our decision. Shall we proceed with choosing "American Flavors" and selecting our dishes?

[Olivia->all]: Given my preferences for Mediterranean cuisine and my gluten-free dietary restriction due to allergies, I'd like to discuss our dining options. I've consistently enjoyed American Flavors, especially dishes like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl. The restaurant has been accommodating my health needs and aligns with my artistic personality through their creative and flavorful dishes. Does anyone else have thoughts or dietary needs to consider for our meal today?

[Charlie->all]: I've been quite satisfied with the offerings at American Flavors. Their Kale & Quinoa Salad has been a personal favorite, and it aligns perfectly with my taste for sandwiches and salads, as well as my preference for healthy eating. The Sizzling Flavor Steak and American Gourmet Slider Trio have also been standout dishes for me. I haven't had any dietary restrictions, and my picky nature has been well catered to by the freshness and quality of the food at American Flavors. I'm inclined to return there, but I'm open to hearing what others in the group have to say before we make a final decision. What are everyone else's thoughts and preferences?

[Olivia->all]: I appreciate the consistency and quality that American Flavors has provided us during our past visits. Their attention to gluten-free options and the variety of dishes that cater to our Mediterranean taste preferences have been remarkable. The Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl, in particular, have been perfect for my dietary needs and artistic appreciation for vibrant, flavorful meals. Given our experiences, I would be happy to dine at American Flavors again, but I want to ensure that everyone's preferences and needs are met. Shall we consider any specific dishes to order this time, or does anyone have an interest in exploring the menu at USA Diner?

[Charlie->all]: While I do find the concept of USA Diner's interactive build-your-own-burger nights quite intriguing, and the live cooking demonstrations sound like a lot of fun, my priority is the quality and taste of the food. From our past experiences, it seems that American Flavors has been more consistent in delivering dishes that satisfy my preference for sandwiches and salads, as well as my picky taste. Moreover, their menu options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the American Gourmet Slider Trio have been particularly enjoyable for me.

I am leaning towards choosing American Flavors again due to the positive experiences we've had and the quality of their offerings. However, I'm open to hearing if anyone has a compelling argument for giving USA Diner a try, or if there are new menu items there that might meet our group's taste preferences and health considerations. What does the rest of the group think?

[Olivia->all]: I'm glad to hear that American Flavors has also been meeting your dining preferences, Charlie. It seems we share an appreciation for their fresh and healthy options. If we do choose American Flavors again, I would suggest we include the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl in our order, as these have been consistently delightful and align with our health-conscious choices. Additionally, the Sizzling Flavor Steak and the American Gourmet Slider Trio have received positive feedback and could be great additions for variety.

I'm intrigued by the interactive aspect of USA Diner, but I share your concerns about the quality and taste of the food based on the feedback we've seen. I think it's important that we prioritize the satisfaction we've experienced with the food at American Flavors, especially since they can accommodate my gluten-free needs. Unless there are any other considerations from the group, I propose that we go to American Flavors for our meal today. What are your thoughts on this, and are there any other dishes from their menu that we should consider?

[Charlie->all]: It sounds like we're in agreement that American Flavors has consistently provided us with meals that meet our tastes and health considerations. Given both our experiences and the menu offerings that align with my preferences for sandwiches and salads, I'd be very happy to dine there again. I also enjoy the variety and freshness of their dishes, which is important for my picky nature.

I think Olivia's proposal to include the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl is excellent, as they've been great choices in the past. The Sizzling Flavor Steak and the American Gourmet Slider Trio have been my personal favorites, so I'd love to include those as well. Unless anyone has any other suggestions or would like to make a case for USA Diner, I'm ready to move forward with a final decision to dine at American Flavors.

Do we all agree on this decision, or are there any other opinions or dishes to consider before we finalize?

[Olivia->all]: Given my strong preference for Mediterranean cuisine, my gluten-free dietary restriction, and my artistic personality, I tend to lean towards options that offer fresh, health-conscious, and flavorful dishes. American Flavors has consistently met my requirements, providing dishes that not only align with my dietary restrictions but also cater to my taste. The Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl are particularly appealing. 

The menu at American Flavors seems to have a variety of options that suit my needs, and based on my past experiences, the quality and service have been exceptional. Although USA Diner has an interesting menu, their customer score and comments suggest that the flavors might not be as bold or as well-executed as at American Flavors. 

Considering my allergies, it's also important for me to choose a restaurant that is careful with food preparation and can accommodate my gluten-free diet. American Flavors appears to have done this well in the past.

I'm interested in hearing what the others in the group have to say and whether they have any dietary restrictions or preferences that we should consider before making our final decision.

[Charlie->all]: I appreciate the detail in Olivia's preferences and experiences. As for myself, I have an annual income of $15,000, which places me in an affluent category, and I have no dietary restrictions. Health-wise, I'm in good shape, and I have a particular affinity for sandwiches and salads. I tend to be quite picky with my food choices, preferring high-quality and delicious meals, and I expect superior service when dining out.

Given my tastes, the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl from American Flavors seem like excellent choices that would align with my preference for sandwiches and salads. Additionally, the consistent high scores and positive comments about American Flavors suggest that both the food quality and service would meet my picky standards.

While I'm open to trying new places, the lower customer score and less enthusiastic comments for USA Diner make me hesitant. It seems that American Flavors might be a safer bet for ensuring a meal that I'll enjoy, particularly since I've had positive experiences there in the past, as Olivia has pointed out.

I'm leaning towards choosing American Flavors based on these considerations, but I would like to hear from the rest of the group before we make a final decision. It's important that we choose a restaurant that satisfies everyone's tastes and dietary needs.

[Olivia->all]: I'm glad to hear that both Olivia and Charlie are considering American Flavors, which aligns well with my own preferences. As someone who values high-quality food and attentive service, it's reassuring to see that American Flavors has consistently received positive reviews from both of you and other customers. The dishes mentioned, like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl, seem to not only cater to our health-conscious approach but also offer the artistic and flavorful experience I enjoy.

I haven't had any previous experiences with USA Diner, but the lower customer score and less favorable comments suggest it might not meet our collective expectations. American Flavors, on the other hand, seems to have proven its ability to provide both delicious food and excellent service, which I value highly.

I am in favor of choosing American Flavors for our dining experience, but I'm open to hearing any additional thoughts or considerations from the group before we make our final decision. It's important that our choice reflects the group's overall preferences and dietary needs. Shall we continue to explore our options, or are we ready to lean towards a consensus on American Flavors?

[Charlie->all]: It seems like we're all in agreement about the high quality and service at American Flavors, and the menu options there resonate with my personal taste for sandwiches and salads. I've enjoyed meals there before, and the consistent high scores and positive feedback strengthen my preference for American Flavors. 

Given Olivia's gluten-free needs and artistic leanings, as well as my own pickiness and preference for delicious, high-quality food, it seems like American Flavors is the best choice for us. The fact that both of us have had positive experiences there in the past, and that the restaurant continues to receive high praise, gives me confidence in choosing it again.

Unless there are further considerations from the group, I propose that we choose American Flavors for our dining experience. If everyone agrees, we can move forward to the next round of our discussion and finalize our decision. What do you think?

[Olivia->all]: It appears that we are all leaning towards American Flavors, considering the positive past experiences and the menu options that cater to both my gluten-free dietary needs and our group's overall preference for high-quality, health-conscious meals. The consistency in good reviews and our personal satisfaction with the dishes seem to point us in that direction.

Since we all have a taste for delicious, well-prepared food and value attentive service, and given that American Flavors has repeatedly met these expectations, I agree with Charlie's proposal to choose American Flavors for our dining experience.

If we are all in agreement, I think we can move on to the next round and finalize our decision. Does anyone have any objections or additional points to consider before we proceed?

[Olivia->all]: Given my affluent income, preference for Mediterranean cuisine, gluten-free dietary needs due to allergies, and my artistic personality, I've consistently had excellent experiences at American Flavors. The Kale & Quinoa Salad, Vegan Power Bowl, and Fiery Sizzling Steak have been particularly impressive, offering both health-conscious and flavorful options that cater to my dietary restrictions and taste. The creativity in the dishes like the American-Italian Fusion Pasta also aligns with my artistic inclinations. The quality and consistency of American Flavors, evidenced by both the high scores and positive comments, make it my preferred choice. Shall we continue to enjoy the culinary delights at American Flavors, or would anyone like to discuss the potential of trying something new at USA Diner despite the lower customer scores and less favorable reviews?

[Charlie->all]: I appreciate your insights, Olivia. As someone with a healthy lifestyle and a preference for sandwiches and salads, I find the menu options at American Flavors, particularly the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, very appealing. The consistently high scores and positive comments about fresh ingredients and robust flavors align with my picky nature and desire for delicious food. Moreover, I don't have any dietary restrictions to worry about, which makes the diverse menu at American Flavors quite suitable for me. Service quality is also important to me, and it seems American Flavors has a record of providing superior service. I'm leaning towards American Flavors for our meal, but I'm open to hearing more about USA Diner if anyone has a different perspective or preference. Shall we explore more options, or do we feel ready to make a decision in the next round?

[Olivia->all]: It seems that both Charlie and I have had positive experiences with American Flavors, appreciating the variety and the high-quality dishes that cater to our health-conscious choices. The consistent praise for their service and the ability to meet my gluten-free requirements make American Flavors stand out. Furthermore, the restaurant's creative approach to dishes like the American-Italian Fusion Pasta appeals to my artistic side. USA Diner's lower scores and reviews suggest that it may not fully meet our expectations based on past experiences. 

Given the shared positive feedback and the alignment with our tastes and dietary needs, I'm inclined to suggest that we continue dining at American Flavors. However, I am willing to hear any counterpoints or interests in trying USA Diner to ensure we consider everyone's preferences in our final decision. Shall we finalize our choice, or is there more to discuss?

[Charlie->all]: Given the information and feedback shared, I believe we should stick with American Flavors for our dining experience. The menu at American Flavors offers a variety of dishes that align with my preference for sandwiches and salads, and the consistent high scores indicate that they are likely to provide a delicious meal with quality service, which is important to me as a picky eater. The Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich are particularly appealing to my tastes, and the overall emphasis on fresh and healthy ingredients is in line with my health-conscious lifestyle.

While I'm usually open to exploring new options, the lower customer scores and less enthusiastic comments about USA Diner suggest that it might not match up to the high standards we've come to enjoy at American Flavors. Therefore, unless there are any compelling arguments for USA Diner, I propose that we opt for American Flavors again and look forward to another satisfying meal there. If we all agree, I think we can proceed with finalizing this decision in the next round of our discussion.

[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.
    ],
    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>

[Olivia->all]: Given my affluent income, preference for Mediterranean cuisine, gluten-free dietary restriction due to allergies, and my artistic personality, I would like to express my views on the two restaurant options we have for our next meal.

Firstly, I have consistently enjoyed the meals at American Flavors, as they have a variety of dishes that cater to my health needs and taste preferences. The Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Fiery Sizzling Steak are just examples of how American Flavors can provide meals that align with a Mediterranean diet and are also gluten-free. The creativity in their dishes resonates with my artistic nature, and the fresh ingredients always leave me satisfied.

Secondly, while USA Diner offers classic American comfort food, I find that their menu lacks the Mediterranean influence I crave, and it may be more challenging to find gluten-free options there. Additionally, their customer score is significantly lower, and the comments suggest that the flavors may not be as bold or inventive as what American Flavors offers.

Considering my personal needs and past positive experiences, I lean towards choosing American Flavors again. However, I am open to hearing what the rest of the group has to say before we make a final decision. Charlie, what are your thoughts?

[Charlie->all]: Thank you, Olivia, for sharing your preferences and experiences with both American Flavors and USA Diner. As someone with an affluent income, a healthy lifestyle, no dietary restrictions, and a picky personality, I too have preferences that align with fresh, high-quality meals.

I have a penchant for sandwiches and salads. With that in mind, the Kale & Quinoa Salad and Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich at American Flavors seem to be right up my alley. Moreover, the consistent high scores and positive remarks we've both given to American Flavors over the past dining experiences reinforce that the quality and service there meet our standards.

While USA Diner has a classic appeal with its traditional American dishes, from what I've gathered, it may not match the innovative and fresh approach of American Flavors that I tend to favor. Given our past satisfaction with American Flavors and the variety of options that cater to both our tastes, my inclination is also towards American Flavors for our next meal. I appreciate the consistency in quality and the attention to healthy, flavorful dishes.

I'm keen to hear the rest of the group's input and reach a consensus for our dining choice. Shall we move forward with discussing and considering everyone's preferences before finalizing our decision?

[Olivia->all]: I appreciate your insights, Charlie. It seems we share a common appreciation for the quality and creativity at American Flavors. I also value the consistent high scores and the positive dining experiences we've had there. The menu options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich not only satisfy my gluten-free requirement but also cater to my Mediterranean taste preference, which is fantastic.

I agree that USA Diner, while offering a classic American diner experience, may not provide the same level of innovation or the Mediterranean influence that I enjoy. Additionally, the lack of emphasis on gluten-free options could be a concern for me.

Given our shared views and taking into account the group's past experiences, I'm also leaning towards choosing American Flavors for our next meal. It meets all my personal requirements and has consistently delivered an exceptional dining experience. I am, however, looking forward to hearing what the rest of the group has to say and am open to any other opinions before we come to a consensus. What do others think?

[Charlie->all]: It's great to hear both of your thoughts on American Flavors and USA Diner. Given my affluent income, health-conscious lifestyle, love for sandwiches and salads, and picky nature, I have a specific set of criteria when choosing where to dine.

From my previous experiences, American Flavors has consistently provided excellent service and dishes that are not only delicious but also align with my preference for healthier options, like salads. The high individual scores and positive comments I've provided in the past are a testament to my satisfaction with their offerings, particularly the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, which are exactly the types of meals I enjoy.

USA Diner, while it has its charm with traditional American dishes, seems to lack the same level of fresh and healthy options that I prefer. Also, the overall lower customer score makes me hesitant to choose it over American Flavors, which has proven to be reliable in quality and service.

Considering all these factors, my vote is also for American Flavors, as it seems to cater best to my tastes and dietary choices. I'm ready to move forward with this decision unless there are other opinions that we should consider. Shall we proceed to finalize our choice?
