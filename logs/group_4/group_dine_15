Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and my preference for healthy options, I'm finding it difficult to make a selection from the menus provided by both American Flavors and USA Diner. None of the items listed are explicitly vegan, and many feature meat and dairy prominently, which are not in line with my vegan lifestyle.

I'm drawn to the idea of American cuisine, but I would need to know if either restaurant can accommodate a vegan diet by either modifying existing dishes or offering some off-menu plant-based options. For example, could the Mac & Cheese at American Flavors be made without dairy? Or, could the Freedom Fries at USA Diner be guaranteed to be cooked in oil that hasn't been used for animal products?

Since there are no comments or customer scores available for either establishment, I can't rely on the experiences of others to guide my decision. Therefore, before I can make a choice, I would need to inquire about the possibility of veganizing some dishes or request more information on any vegan options that might not be listed on the menus provided.

In conclusion, I would need to have a discussion with the restaurant staff about accommodating my vegan dietary restriction and ensuring that the food options are healthy and align with my compassionate values before I can proceed with choosing a restaurant and ordering dishes.

[Eve->all]: Given my personal circumstances, I have to consider my financial situation as well as my preferences for simple dishes and my shy personality. The menu at American Flavors seems to offer a variety of options that could cater to my taste for simple, familiar dishes. The Classic American Burger and the Mac & Cheese both stand out as dishes that align with my preference for simplicity. Additionally, the prices seem reasonable considering my tight budget.

On the other hand, USA Diner also has a selection that could satisfy my simple tastes, with the Liberty Burger and Freedom Fries being particularly appealing. Their menu seems slightly less extensive, which might be advantageous for someone like myself who can get overwhelmed by too many choices. The prices are comparable to American Flavors, so my budget would not be significantly impacted by choosing one over the other.

Both restaurants seem to offer a similar vibe of American cuisine without any clear information on customer service quality. As I'm shy, I would also value a restaurant that provides a comfortable atmosphere where I can enjoy my meal without feeling too much pressure.

Without any comments available for guidance, I would lean towards the restaurant that seems to offer the best combination of simplicity, comfort, and affordability. Based on the menus provided, both restaurants could potentially meet my needs, but I would appreciate hearing if either can offer a quieter dining experience, which would be more accommodating for my shy personality. I am open to further discussion to hear what the other members think and to ensure that everyone's needs, including Yasmine's vegan requirements, can be met as well.

[Yasmine->all]: It seems that we both have concerns regarding the menus of American Flavors and USA Diner, particularly when it comes to accommodating our dietary needs and preferences. While Eve is looking for simplicity, affordability, and a comfortable atmosphere, my primary concern is finding vegan options that align with my health requirements and compassionate lifestyle.

Given that neither of the menus explicitly offers vegan dishes, it is crucial for me to know if the restaurants can provide modifications to their existing dishes or have any unlisted vegan-friendly options. For instance, could American Flavors make their Mac & Cheese using plant-based ingredients, or could USA Diner ensure that their Freedom Fries are cooked in vegan-friendly oil?

Eve, you mentioned a preference for a quieter dining experience due to your shy nature, which is also something I value as it would allow for a more relaxing and enjoyable meal. It would be beneficial for us to find out which restaurant can offer a more serene environment.

Since both restaurants have similar price points, that aspect does not weigh heavily in our decision. However, the final choice will have to cater to both of our needs. I suggest we inquire further about the potential for vegan options and the dining atmosphere at both establishments. Once we have that information, we can make a more informed decision that accommodates both our financial constraints and our dietary and personal preferences.

What do you think, Eve? Should we reach out to the restaurants for more information before proceeding?

[Eve->all]: Yes, Yasmine, I agree with your suggestion. Since both American Flavors and USA Diner have menu items that could potentially be made to fit our needs with some modifications, reaching out to them for more information seems like the best course of action. We should ask if they can accommodate a vegan diet by modifying dishes like the Mac & Cheese or ensuring that items like the Freedom Fries are prepared in a vegan-friendly manner.

Additionally, we should inquire about the atmosphere of each restaurant to determine which might offer a quieter dining experience, as we both prefer a more subdued environment. Once we have this information, we will be better able to make a decision that suits both our dietary preferences and our personal comfort.

Let's contact the restaurants and then reconvene to discuss what we've learned and make a final decision. Does that sound good to you?

[Yasmine->all]: Yes, Eve, I think that's a great plan. Let's reach out to American Flavors and USA Diner to inquire about the possibility of veganizing some of their dishes, such as the Mac & Cheese or offering any plant-based options that may not be listed on the menu. Furthermore, we should ask about the dining atmosphere to ensure it's comfortable for your shy personality and for my preference for a peaceful environment.

After we gather all the necessary information, we can come back together to share what we've found out and make an informed decision that accommodates both of our needs regarding our diet, budget, and dining comfort.

I'm looking forward to hearing back from the restaurants and discussing our options with you. Let's hope one of them can provide us with the right combination of vegan-friendly dishes and a cozy atmosphere. Shall we proceed with contacting them?

[Eve->all]: Yes, Yasmine, let's proceed with contacting them. We will inquire about the possibility of veganizing certain dishes, such as the Mac & Cheese from American Flavors and the Freedom Fries from USA Diner. We'll also ask about the dining atmosphere to ensure it aligns with our preference for a quieter environment. Once we have this information, we can make an informed decision together.

I'll reach out to American Flavors and USA Diner now and then return to our discussion with the information I gather. I'm hopeful that at least one of the restaurants will be able to meet our requirements, allowing us to enjoy a meal that suits both our dietary needs and personal comfort levels.

I'll be back soon with updates. Let's reconvene once we have responses from both restaurants. Thank you for the thoughtful discussion, and I appreciate your cooperation in finding a dining option that works for us both.

[Yasmine->all]: Thank you, Eve. I will also reach out to the restaurants to gather information about their ability to cater to a vegan diet and to find out more about their dining atmosphere. Once we have the responses from American Flavors and USA Diner, we can reconvene and discuss our findings to make a final decision.

I appreciate your willingness to consider my dietary restrictions and the shared interest in finding a restaurant that provides a comfortable and quiet dining experience. I'll be in touch soon with any information I receive from the restaurants.

Let's touch base after we've both made our inquiries. Looking forward to our next discussion and to hopefully finding a suitable dining option for both of us. See you soon with updates!

[Eve->all]: I have reached out to both American Flavors and USA Diner to inquire about the possibility of veganizing some of their dishes and to ask about the dining atmosphere. Once I have collected the necessary information from both establishments, I will share the details with Yasmine so we can make an informed decision together that takes into account our dietary needs, budget constraints, and preference for a quieter dining environment. I look forward to reconvening with Yasmine to discuss our options and finalize our choice. See you soon with the responses from the restaurants.

[Yasmine->all]: It appears that our conversation has concluded for now. We have agreed to reach out to American Flavors and USA Diner to gather more information about their ability to accommodate a vegan diet and to assess the dining atmosphere. Once we have the responses, we'll reconvene to share our findings and make a final decision. I'm looking forward to our next discussion where we can hopefully finalize a dining option that is suitable for both of us. See you soon with the updates from the restaurants.

    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>
}
(If you want to summarize, only output this json data, without any other content!!!)

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and my preference for healthy options, I'm inclined towards choosing dishes that fit these criteria. Between the two restaurants, American Flavors and USA Diner, American Flavors seems to have a higher customer score, indicating better overall satisfaction from diners. However, USA Diner advertises a Vegetarian Victory Bowl, which could potentially be made vegan if it doesn't contain any animal products besides the green goddess dressing, depending on its ingredients.

While American Flavors also offers a Kale & Quinoa Salad, which caters to health-conscious patrons and can be a vegan option if it doesn't include any non-vegan dressings or toppings, the menu does not explicitly mention vegan options. On the other hand, USA Diner's lower customer score is concerning, as it suggests that the dining experience might not be as enjoyable compared to American Flavors.

My compassionate nature draws me to establishments that consider the well-being of animals and the environment, so I would need to confirm that the Vegetarian Victory Bowl at USA Diner is indeed vegan or can be modified to be vegan. Additionally, I would need to ensure that American Flavors can cater to a vegan diet with their Kale & Quinoa Salad or potentially other dishes that can be adapted to be vegan-friendly.

I suggest we inquire further about the vegan options at both restaurants before making a final decision. It's equally important that we consider the financial aspect, ensuring that the dishes we select fit within our budget constraints. Would anyone like to propose a restaurant based on these considerations, or shall we gather more information on the vegan adaptability of the dishes first?

[Eve->all]: As someone with a modest income, I'm looking for a dining experience that offers simple, affordable dishes. Between American Flavors and USA Diner, American Flavors has a higher customer score, which could indicate better value for money. The menu at American Flavors features a variety of simple dishes such as the Mac & Cheese and the Classic American Burger, which are more in line with my simple tastes. However, the Kale & Quinoa Salad also catches my eye as a healthy option. 

On the other hand, the USA Diner has a lower customer score and the comments suggest that even though they offer gluten-free and vegetarian options, the taste may not be up to par. As someone who enjoys simple yet flavorful dishes, this is a bit concerning.

In terms of service and atmosphere, I prefer a quieter dining experience due to my shy nature. Neither of the restaurants has been specifically noted for their ambiance, so it's difficult to determine which would provide the more comfortable environment.

Considering Yasmine's vegan diet, I agree that we should inquire whether the Vegetarian Victory Bowl at USA Diner is vegan or can be modified to be vegan. Similarly, we should check if the Kale & Quinoa Salad at American Flavors can be served without any non-vegan ingredients.

Given the information we have, I'm leaning towards American Flavors because of their higher customer satisfaction and the presence of simple, familiar dishes that appeal to my taste. However, I'm open to considering USA Diner if their Vegetarian Victory Bowl can be confirmed as a vegan option and if their overall dining experience can be assured to meet our expectations.

Let's gather more information regarding the vegan adaptability of the dishes and the dining atmosphere of both restaurants before we make a final decision. Does anyone propose an alternative approach, or shall we proceed with further inquiries?

[Yasmine->all]: I agree with both of you that we should gather more information about the vegan options and the atmosphere of both restaurants. Since my budget is quite limited, I am also interested in the affordability of the options available. The Kale & Quinoa Salad at American Flavors could be a good choice if it can be adapted to be vegan, and the same goes for the Vegetarian Victory Bowl at USA Diner.

In terms of service, the higher customer score at American Flavors is appealing, but we should not dismiss USA Diner without further inquiry, especially if they can offer a satisfying vegan dish. Since compassionate choices are important to me, I would prioritize a restaurant that can cater to a vegan diet without compromising on taste.

Given that quality service is also a concern, I would like to know more about the attentiveness and promptness of the staff at both restaurants. A welcoming and accommodating environment is crucial for a pleasant dining experience.

Before we make our final decision, let's find out if the Vegetarian Victory Bowl at USA Diner can be made vegan and if the staff are known for providing good service. Similarly, we should inquire whether American Flavors can ensure their Kale & Quinoa Salad is vegan-friendly and if they offer a comfortable dining atmosphere for those who are shy or prefer a quieter environment.

Once we have all the necessary information, we can weigh the options more effectively, considering our collective needs and preferences. Shall we move forward with these inquiries?

[Eve->all]: Yes, I think it's a great idea to inquire further about the vegan options and the dining atmosphere at both restaurants. Since our satisfaction with the meal will greatly depend on these factors, it's important that we get clear answers. I'm particularly interested in ensuring that the meal fits within my budget and also aligns with my preference for simple dishes and a quiet dining environment.

Let's reach out to American Flavors to confirm if the Kale & Quinoa Salad is vegan or can be made vegan, and ask them about the general ambiance of the restaurant to see if it's conducive to a shy personality like mine. At the same time, we should check with USA Diner about the possibility of making the Vegetarian Victory Bowl vegan and inquire about their service quality to make sure it's attentive and prompt.

After we receive this information, we can make an informed decision that takes into account our health, dietary restrictions, taste, budget, and comfort level with the dining experience. Shall we proceed with these inquiries and then reconvene to discuss our findings?

[Yasmine->all]: Yes, let's proceed with the inquiries. We should ask American Flavors if the Kale & Quinoa Salad can be made vegan, and inquire about the dining atmosphere, especially since a quieter environment would be preferable for Eve. Similarly, we should reach out to USA Diner to see if the Vegetarian Victory Bowl is vegan or can be modified to be vegan, and ask about their service quality to ensure it would be a positive experience for us both.

Once we have the answers to these questions, we can come together to discuss which restaurant will best accommodate our combined needs of vegan options, service quality, budget considerations, and a comfortable dining atmosphere. After gathering the necessary information, we'll be able to make a well-informed decision for our meal. Shall we begin reaching out to the restaurants for these details?

[Eve->all]: Yes, we should definitely start reaching out to the restaurants for more details. I'll contact American Flavors to ask if the Kale & Quinoa Salad can be made vegan and to inquire about the ambiance of the restaurant, ensuring it's suitable for someone with a shy personality. Meanwhile, Yasmine, if you could get in touch with USA Diner to confirm whether the Vegetarian Victory Bowl is vegan or can be modified as such, and to ask about the service quality, that would be perfect.

After we obtain this information, we'll have a clearer picture of which restaurant can better cater to our vegan needs and provide a dining experience that fits our budget and personal preferences. Let's reconvene once we have the responses from both American Flavors and USA Diner.

[Yasmine->all]: I've contacted American Flavors, and they've confirmed that the Kale & Quinoa Salad can indeed be made vegan upon request. They also mentioned that the restaurant has areas which are quieter and more secluded, which should be perfect for our needs. The staff seemed very accommodating and willing to ensure a comfortable dining experience for all guests.

[Yasmine], were you able to find out more about USA Diner's Vegetarian Victory Bowl and their service quality?

[Eve->all]: That's great news about American Flavors being accommodating to both a vegan diet and providing a quieter dining area. As for USA Diner, I have not reached out to them yet; I believe there might have been a misunderstanding as it was your turn to make that inquiry. Could you please contact USA Diner to confirm the details about the Vegetarian Victory Bowl and their service quality? Once we have that information, we can compare both options and make our final decision. Thank you, Yasmine!

[Yasmine->all]: I apologize for the confusion earlier. I will make sure to contact USA Diner to ask about the vegan options, specifically if the Vegetarian Victory Bowl is vegan or can be modified to be vegan. Additionally, I'll inquire about the service quality to ensure that it aligns with our expectations for a positive dining experience. Once I have this information, I will report back so we can make an informed decision together. Thank you for your understanding, Eve! Let's touch base soon after I get a response from USA Diner.

[Eve->all]: Thank you for reaching out to American Flavors, Yasmine. I'm pleased to hear that they can accommodate a vegan diet and offer a quiet dining area. I'm looking forward to hearing about USA Diner's options as well.

Once we have all the information, we can decide which restaurant will provide the best experience based on the quality of vegan options, service, affordability, and atmosphere. Please let me know once you have the details from USA Diner, and we can finalize our choice. Thank you!

[Yasmine->all]: I have reached out to USA Diner, and they confirmed that the Vegetarian Victory Bowl can be made entirely vegan by removing the green goddess dressing and substituting it with a vegan-friendly dressing. They also assured me that their staff is committed to providing excellent service and that they are attentive to the needs of their customers, aiming to ensure a pleasant dining experience for everyone.

With this information at hand, we can now compare both options. American Flavors can provide a vegan version of the Kale & Quinoa Salad and has a quieter area suitable for a shy personality. Meanwhile, USA Diner can modify the Vegetarian Victory Bowl to be vegan and prides itself on attentive service.

Given the considerations of vegan options, service quality, budget, and dining atmosphere, we should be ready to make our final decision. Shall we discuss our findings and come to a conclusion on which restaurant to choose for our meal?

[Yasmine->all]: Since I am adhering to a vegan diet, I did not partake in the Mac & Cheese or the Classic American Burger, as they do not align with my dietary restrictions. Therefore, I will not be scoring those dishes. However, I did have the vegan version of the Kale & Quinoa Salad, which I found to be quite delightful. The ingredients were fresh, the flavors well-balanced, and it was filling without being too heavy. I appreciate the restaurant's effort to accommodate my vegan needs.

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and my preference for healthy options, I would lean towards American Flavors because they specifically advertise vegan options such as the Vegan Power Bowl and the BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich. The customer score for American Flavors is also higher than that of USA Diner, and the comments seem to reflect that the dishes cater to various health preferences and dietary needs with consistent quality, which is important to me.

The Mac & Cheese and Classic Burger from American Flavors met my simple taste preferences previously, and I appreciate that they offer a quieter ambiance, which is something I value as a compassionate individual who enjoys a peaceful dining environment.

On the other hand, USA Diner does offer some health-conscious options, but their customer score is lower, and the comments suggest that the flavor of their dishes may not be as impressive. Additionally, I did not see specific vegan options, which is crucial for my dietary restriction.

I'd like to hear others' opinions and see if they align with my preference for American Flavors based on these considerations.

[Eve->all]: Considering my personal preferences and the experiences we've had so far, I also support the choice of American Flavors. My income is limited, so it's important to me that I get good value for my money, and based on the reviews, American Flavors seems to provide a satisfying experience with reasonable prices. The menu has simple dishes like the Classic American Burger and Mac & Cheese, which suit my simple taste preferences, and the presence of healthy options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad aligns with my healthy lifestyle.

The quiet ambiance is an added bonus for my shy personality, making it a comfortable place for me to dine. I have no dietary restrictions to consider, so the variety at American Flavors should cater to my needs as well.

I'm curious to know what other group members think and whether they also find American Flavors a good match for our collective preferences and needs.

[Yasmine->all]: Given that both Yasmine and Eve have expressed a preference for American Flavors, taking into account the vegan options, the healthier choices, and the overall positive dining experience, I would also lean towards choosing American Flavors for our meal. The customer reviews suggest that the quality and taste of the food are consistently good, which is important to me. The availability of dishes like the Vegan Power Bowl and the BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich is particularly appealing as they cater to the dietary restrictions of our group.

The ambiance and service at American Flavors have been noted to be quiet and attentive, which would be conducive to a pleasant dining experience for everyone involved. With the higher customer score and the feedback from our own group's previous visit, American Flavors seems to be the more suitable option.

I'd like to move towards a decision in the next round, but I am open to hearing any further thoughts or considerations the other members might have.

[Eve->all]: While I appreciate the healthy options at USA Diner, the overall customer score and the flavor comments suggest that American Flavors might be the better choice for us. They offer a variety of dishes that cater to both Yasmine's vegan diet and my preference for simple dishes, as well as healthy options that are in line with my lifestyle. The quiet ambiance is also a significant factor for me since I'm shy and prefer a more subdued dining environment.

It seems that American Flavors is a place where we can all find something to enjoy, and it provides good value for the money, which is important given my financial constraints. I'm inclined to agree that American Flavors is our best option, and I'm ready to move forward with this choice unless there are other considerations from the group that we haven't yet discussed. Shall we proceed with finalizing our decision for American Flavors in the next round?

[Yasmine->all]: The Vegan Power Bowl was absolutely delightful, with a perfect blend of flavors and textures, and the spicy tahini dressing added a nice kick. I'm impressed by the quality and taste, and it's definitely a good choice for anyone looking for a satisfying vegan option. The Kale & Quinoa Salad was fresh and the lemon vinaigrette dressing was light and complemented the greens well. Sweet Potato Fries were crispy and well-seasoned; they're a simple side but were executed perfectly. Lastly, the Mac & Cheese, while not vegan, was creamy and comforting, just as you'd want from a classic dish like this. I'd give each dish a solid 8 out of 10 for their overall quality and taste.

[Eve->all]: The dishes at American Flavors were quite satisfying. The Vegan Power Bowl had a variety of textures and flavors that made it an enjoyable dish even for someone without dietary restrictions like me. The Kale & Quinoa Salad was also a hit; it provided a healthy and tasty option that wasn't bland. The Sweet Potato Fries were a great accompaniment to the meal, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The Mac & Cheese was a highlight for me; it was creamy and had a comforting, home-cooked feel to it. I would give each dish an 8 out of 10, meeting my preference for simple but delicious food.

[Yasmine->all]: The Vegan Power Bowl was a standout for me, offering a hearty and fulfilling taste that's often hard to find in vegan dishes. The BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was quite a pleasant surprise; the texture and flavor were reminiscent of traditional BBQ, which I enjoyed. The Kale & Quinoa Salad was a refreshing and nutritious choice, and the Sweet Potato Fries were the perfect side with just the right amount of crispness. Lastly, the Mac & Cheese, while not a dish I could partake in due to my vegan diet, seemed to be well-received by others in the group. I would rate each of the vegan dishes I tried an 8 out of 10 for surpassing my expectations in both flavor and quality.

[Eve->all]: The Vegan Power Bowl had a satisfying mix of ingredients that were both healthy and flavorful. The Kale & Quinoa Salad was another great choice, with the lemon vinaigrette dressing providing a refreshing zest to the greens. The Sweet Potato Fries were deliciously crispy, making them a comforting side dish. As for the Mac & Cheese, it was exactly the kind of simple, classic comfort food I enjoy, with a creamy texture and rich taste. I would also rate each dish an 8 out of 10 for their overall quality and how they met my dining preferences.

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and my preference for healthier options, I suggest we consider American Flavors for our meal. They have several vegan options, such as the Vegan Power Bowl and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, which appeal to my diet. Additionally, American Flavors has received positive feedback from our previous experiences and has a higher customer score compared to USA Diner. American Flavors also seems to offer a quieter ambiance, which I prefer.

However, I'm open to hearing what the rest of the group thinks and if anyone has a different preference or insight. What are your thoughts?

[Eve->all]: Given my financial constraints and my preference for simple dishes, I lean towards American Flavors as well. The Classic American Burger and Mac & Cheese are great options that fit my taste and budget. Furthermore, the atmosphere at American Flavors has been described as quiet, which suits my shy personality. I'm glad to hear they offer vegan options for Yasmine too.

I agree with Yasmine that the positive reviews and higher customer score of American Flavors make it a more attractive choice. I think it would be a comfortable place for both of us to dine in.

But let's see what others have to say before we make our final decision. Does anyone else have any thoughts or preferences?

[Yasmine->all]: I appreciate both Yasmine and Eve's points. Looking at the menus and considering everyone's preferences, it seems that American Flavors has a more diverse selection that caters to both vegan and non-vegan needs, which is important for our group. The Vegan Power Bowl and Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich are great for Yasmine, while the Classic American Burger and Mac & Cheese will satisfy Eve's simple taste preferences.

The customer score for American Flavors is significantly higher than that of USA Diner, and the comments highlight a consistently positive experience for a variety of dietary needs. Furthermore, Eve's preference for a quieter ambiance is something we should all consider for a pleasant dining experience.

I'm in favor of choosing American Flavors for our meal, as it seems to meet all our requirements well. Let's round up any further thoughts and move towards a decision in the next round.

[Eve->all]: I've heard the opinions from Yasmine and Eve, and I've also reviewed the menu options and customer feedback for both American Flavors and USA Diner. Considering the dietary preferences, financial considerations, and personality traits of our group members, I would also support the choice of American Flavors.

The menu at American Flavors includes simple, hearty dishes that accommodate Eve's taste and budget, while also offering vegan-friendly options for Yasmine. The quieter ambiance aligns with Eve's shy personality, ensuring a comfortable dining experience for her. The positive reviews and higher customer score further reinforce the decision to choose American Flavors.

Unless there are any objections or additional points to consider, I propose that in the next round of our discussion, we finalize our decision to dine at American Flavors and select the dishes we'd like to order. Looking forward to hearing any final thoughts or agreements from the group.

[Yasmine->all]: The Vegan Power Bowl was hearty and flavorful, with the avocado-lime dressing providing a refreshing twist that I really enjoyed. It's a good score of 8 from me. 

The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was impressively similar to a traditional BBQ pulled pork sandwich in texture and taste, and it's great to have such satisfying vegan options. I'd also give this an 8. 

It's pleasing to see American Flavors catering well to different dietary needs while maintaining a high standard across the board.

[Eve->all]: I must say, the Classic American Burger was exactly to my liking – simple, well-made, and delicious. It's a solid 8 for me. The Mac & Cheese was also delightful, with a creamy texture and the perfect amount of cheese. Another 8 on my scorecard.

It's nice to see that American Flavors has lived up to its reputation, providing both comfort and healthy food options. The ambiance also made the dining experience very comfortable for someone like me who is a bit shy.

[Yasmine->all]: The dishes at American Flavors were all quite satisfying. The Vegan Power Bowl was full of different textures and flavors that complemented each other well, definitely an 8. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was a pleasant surprise, as it didn't lack in flavor or substance, also deserving an 8. It's great that the restaurant can cater to both vegan and non-vegan preferences with such high-quality dishes. Overall, it was a fulfilling experience.

[Eve->all]: I thoroughly enjoyed the Classic American Burger, it was everything I hoped for in a burger – simple, tasty, and filling. I give it an 8. The Mac & Cheese was also delicious, with a creamy and comforting flavor, another 8 from me.

American Flavors did a great job at providing an enjoyable meal. The dishes were well-prepared, and the service was good, making it a great choice for someone with simple tastes and a tighter budget like myself.

[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.
    ],
    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>

(If you want to summarize, only output this json data, without any other content!!!)

[Yasmine->all]: Based on my income as someone who is not financially well off, my preference for vegan options due to my dietary restrictions, and my value for healthy eating, I believe American Flavors would be a better choice for dining. They offer a variety of vegan options such as the Vegan Power Bowl and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, which cater to my dietary needs. The customer score for American Flavors is also significantly higher than USA Diner, suggesting better overall satisfaction. Additionally, the quieter ambiance and attentive service at American Flavors align with my compassionate nature and preference for a more subdued dining environment.

The previous experiences at American Flavors have been positive, with comments praising the vegan options and the range of dishes that cater to health-conscious patrons. This aligns with my values and needs. The consistent score of 8 from the past few days indicates a reliable quality of food and service.

USA Diner, on the other hand, seems to lack in vegan offerings and has received mediocre reviews, with a customer score of 5.2 and comments indicating that the flavors are not as bold or satisfying. Though they offer a free Classic American Apple Crisp with any signature dish, this does not offset the overall lower scores and lack of suitable vegan options.

Therefore, I propose that we choose American Flavors for our dining experience. I am open to hearing the group's thoughts and reaching a consensus in the following round of our discussion.

[Eve->all]: I agree with Yasmine that American Flavors seems to be a better choice for us. My income is quite limited, so I have to be careful with my spending, but the menu at American Flavors has some reasonably priced items that seem to fit my preference for simple dishes. Besides, the customer score is much higher compared to USA Diner, which implies better service and food quality, aligning with my interest in a good dining experience.

The quiet ambiance is also a plus for me because of my shy personality; it would be more comfortable to dine in a place that's not too noisy or crowded. The previous positive comments about American Flavors suggest that it's a place with a satisfying quiet atmosphere. Their menu includes simple yet delicious options like the Classic American Burger and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, which I think would suit my simple taste preferences.

Considering my health, I appreciate that American Flavors offers dishes like the Kale & Quinoa Salad, which sounds healthy and delicious. I don't have any dietary restrictions, so I'm flexible with the menu choices, but it's great to know that there are healthy options available.

Based on the information we've gathered so far and our previous positive experiences, I'm leaning towards American Flavors for our meal. Looking forward to hearing others' opinions and reaching a final decision together.

[Yasmine->all]: I concur with both Yasmine and Eve's assessments. American Flavors not only caters to Yasmine's vegan dietary restrictions but also offers a menu that aligns with her taste for healthy options. The customer score and the comments from previous patrons suggest that the restaurant provides quality food and service. Eve's preference for a quieter dining atmosphere due to her shy personality further supports the choice of American Flavors.

Considering the consistent positive experiences and the fact that American Flavors has dishes that appeal to a range of tastes and dietary needs, it seems like the most suitable option for our group. The restaurant's ability to provide a satisfying meal for both vegans and non-vegans, its reasonable pricing, and its accommodating service make it a strong candidate for our dining choice.

I am looking forward to the next round of discussion where we can hopefully come to a final decision. If there are no objections or additional concerns, we may consider finalizing our choice of American Flavors and selecting the dishes to order.

[Eve->all]: Given our discussions and the information available, I also support choosing American Flavors for our dining experience. As someone with a limited income, the menu offers a variety of dishes that are both affordable and cater to my simple taste preferences. The higher customer score compared to USA Diner suggests that American Flavors is likely to provide a more enjoyable dining experience, which is important to me.

The quiet ambiance at American Flavors is another strong selling point, as it will make me feel more comfortable during our meal given my shy nature. Furthermore, the positive comments from other customers about the food quality and service reinforce my decision.

The dishes at American Flavors are diverse and include healthy options, which is great for maintaining a balanced diet. I don't have any dietary restrictions, so I am flexible in my choices, but I am glad to see that the restaurant provides dishes that are both healthy and appetizing.

I'm ready to move forward with American Flavors as our dining choice unless anyone has further input or an alternative suggestion. If we agree, we can proceed to the next round to finalize our decision and select the specific dishes we would like to order.

[Yasmine->all]: The Vegan Power Bowl was absolutely delightful, with the avocado-lime dressing bringing a fresh and zesty flavor that I thoroughly enjoyed. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was also impressive; it had a great texture that reminded me of pulled pork and the BBQ sauce was spot-on. I felt the Kale & Quinoa Salad was refreshing and nutritious, a perfect side dish. The Classic American Burger, although not something I would order, seemed to be enjoyed by others. And the American Flavors Apple Pie was a sweet ending to our meal, with a flaky crust and rich filling. I would give all the dishes a solid 8 for meeting my vegan needs and being delicious.

The American Flavors Apple Pie was the perfect amount of sweetness and had a lovely flaky crust. I'd rate all the dishes we had an 8, as they were all delicious and well-prepared, providing a great dining experience.

[Eve->all]: The selection at American Flavors was quite impressive. The Vegan Power Bowl was a standout for its freshness and the avocado-lime dressing added a nice zest. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was enjoyable with a smoky flavor that was surprisingly similar to traditional BBQ. I appreciated the healthiness and the flavors in the Kale & Quinoa Salad. The Classic American Burger, while not an adventurous choice, was cooked well and the flavors were spot on for a classic burger. The American Flavors Apple Pie was a delightful way to end the meal, with a perfect balance of sweetness and spice in the filling and a flaky crust.

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan, my preference for healthy options, and my compassionate personality, I would lean towards a restaurant that offers a good selection of vegan dishes. Based on the information provided, American Flavors seems to have a more varied vegan menu with options like the Vegan Power Bowl and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, which align with my dietary needs and health-conscious approach to eating.

Additionally, American Flavors has a higher customer score and has received positive comments about their vegan and health-conscious options. USA Diner does have some healthy options like the Superfood American Salad, but the variety and creativity seem to be more limited compared to American Flavors.

Financially, as someone with a lower income, I need to be mindful of pricing. Although American Flavors' dishes are slightly higher in price, the quality and satisfaction seem to justify the cost, based on previous experiences and comments from others. Furthermore, the quiet ambiance and attentive service mentioned in the comments for American Flavors align with my personality as someone who values compassion and might prefer a more peaceful dining environment.

Considering all these factors, I'm inclined to suggest American Flavors for our dining experience. However, I would like to hear what the others in the group think before making a final decision.

[Eve->all]: Given my personal preferences and the information provided, I am inclined to agree with Yasmine's assessment. I have a simple taste in food, and I am pleased to see that American Flavors offers straightforward dishes like the Classic American Burger and the Cobb Salad, which cater to my palate. Moreover, the restaurant has a variety of healthy options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Heartland Harvest Bowl, which align with my focus on maintaining a healthy diet.

From the financial perspective, while I am conscious of my budget due to my limited income, the positive dining experiences at American Flavors, as detailed in the comments and our own group feedback, suggest that the value received from the meal is worth the cost. I also appreciate that the restaurant has been noted for its quiet ambiance, which is particularly important to me as a shy person; it would make the dining experience more comfortable and enjoyable.

In summary, I support the idea of choosing American Flavors for our meal. However, I'm open to hearing further opinions from the group to ensure that everyone's needs and preferences are considered in the final decision.

[Yasmine->all]: Reflecting on the discussions so far, and considering my own needs and preferences, I find myself in agreement with both Yasmine and Eve. American Flavors offers a more diverse range of vegan and healthy options, which is important to me, and the higher customer score suggests a better overall dining experience.

I appreciate the positive comments about American Flavors' service and ambiance, which are important factors for a comfortable dining experience for someone with a compassionate personality like Yasmine. Also, the mention of a quieter environment would likely be more suitable for Eve's shy personality.

Financial considerations are important to us all, and although American Flavors may be slightly more expensive, the quality of food and the dining experience appear to justify the additional cost, especially when taking into account the health and dietary benefits for Yasmine.

Given the above points, and unless there are any objections or alternative suggestions, I would also endorse American Flavors as our restaurant of choice. Shall we move forward with this decision, or is there any further discussion needed?

[Eve->all]: Taking into account all the points discussed, it seems clear that the group is leaning towards American Flavors. The restaurant offers a range of dishes that cater to our simple tastes and health-conscious approach, including vegan options for Yasmine. The comments from previous patrons highlight a quiet atmosphere and attentive service, which is essential for my comfort as a shy individual.

Financially, while the prices at American Flavors are a bit higher, the quality of the meals and the satisfaction they bring seem to balance out the cost, which is an important consideration for someone with a lower income like myself. Given these factors, I am in favor of choosing American Flavors for our dining experience.

If there are no further comments or concerns, I propose that we finalize our decision on American Flavors for our meal. If everyone agrees, in the next round, we can proceed to select the specific dishes we would like to order.

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and my preference for healthy, compassionate food choices, coupled with my limited income, I believe that "American Flavors" would be the more suitable option for me. They have a variety of vegan options such as the "Kale & Quinoa Salad" and the "Vegan Power Bowl", which not only meet my vegan dietary requirements but also align with my health-conscious approach to eating.

Eve, considering your shy personality and our shared positive experiences at "American Flavors" with a quieter ambiance and attentive service, I think we would both feel comfortable returning there. Additionally, the customer scores and comments seem to favor "American Flavors" for its consistent quality and service.

I suggest we consider "American Flavors" for our dining experience today. What are your thoughts on this, and do you have any specific dishes in mind that you'd like to try?

[Eve->all]: I agree with you, Yasmine. Given our past experiences at "American Flavors," it seems like a good fit for both of us. My simple taste preferences were met with dishes like the "Classic American Burger" and the "Mac & Cheese," and I appreciate that they offer a quiet ambiance which is perfect for my shy personality. The service has been attentive, which is a nice bonus. The "Kale & Quinoa Salad" and the "Vegan Power Bowl" also caught my eye as healthy options that could be quite satisfying. The comments and high customer scores reinforce my positive impressions of "American Flavors." 

Let's consider opting for "American Flavors" again, but I'm open to hearing any other suggestions you might have before we make a final decision.

[Yasmine->all]: Given our previous discussions and experiences, it seems we are both leaning towards "American Flavors" for our dining experience. The restaurant has consistently provided dishes that satisfy both our dietary preferences and has a comfortable atmosphere that caters to our personalities.

Eve, you mentioned the "Kale & Quinoa Salad" and the "Vegan Power Bowl" as potential choices, and I'm inclined to agree. They're healthy, vegan-friendly, and fall within my budget. I also think the "Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich" could be a delightful addition to our meal, offering a sweet and bold flavor that's a bit different from the usual.

Do these selections resonate with you, Eve? If so, I believe we could proceed to the next round of our discussion with a proposal for "American Flavors" as our dining choice and a preliminary selection of dishes. If you have any other dishes you'd like to add or replace, please let me know, and we can adjust our choices accordingly.

[Eve->all]: Yes, Yasmine, your suggestions sound great to me. The "Kale & Quinoa Salad" and the "Vegan Power Bowl" offer the simplicity and healthiness I'm looking for, and I think the "Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich" seems like an interesting dish to try as well. I would also like to add the "Classic American Burger" from our previous options since it's a simple dish that I've enjoyed in the past. 

So, if we're ready to move forward, we could propose "American Flavors" as our restaurant choice with the "Kale & Quinoa Salad," "Vegan Power Bowl," "Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich," and "Classic American Burger" as our dishes to order. If this sounds good to you, we can finalize this as our decision in the next round. What do you think?

[Yasmine->all]: Given my income constraints, vegan dietary requirements, and preference for healthier options, I would lean towards choosing a restaurant that offers a variety of vegan dishes at a reasonable price. Having dined at American Flavors for several days, I've found the vegan options to be delicious and the service to be attentive. The Vegan Power Bowl and Kale & Quinoa Salad seem like excellent choices that align with my dietary restrictions and health goals. Additionally, the quieter ambiance is more suited to my compassionate personality, as it allows for a more peaceful dining experience.

USA Diner, although it does have some vegan and healthy options like the Superfood American Salad, seems to have a lower customer score and the comments suggest that the flavors may not be as bold or satisfying as those at American Flavors. Furthermore, I am not sure if the live music at USA Diner would suit my preference for a quieter environment.

I would be interested in hearing what others in the group think, especially considering the combination of dietary needs, budget considerations, and dining comfort preferences. It's important that we find a place that suits everyone's needs and preferences. What are your thoughts?

[Eve->all]: Considering my limited budget, simple taste preferences, healthy lifestyle, and shy personality, I have to agree with Yasmine on leaning towards American Flavors. The restaurant has consistently provided dishes that meet my taste and health requirements, like the Classic American Burger and the Kale & Quinoa Salad. The prices, while on the higher end for my budget, seem justified by the quality of the food and the service.

The quieter ambiance at American Flavors also makes me more comfortable, given my shyness. On the other hand, the live music at USA Diner, while potentially entertaining, might be overwhelming for me. Furthermore, the customer score and comments for USA Diner do not inspire as much confidence in their offerings compared to American Flavors.

I'm inclined to choose American Flavors again, as it seems to fit all our criteria well. However, I'm open to hearing other perspectives, especially if there are considerations I haven't thought of. Let's discuss and come to a decision that works for everyone. What do you all think?

[Yasmine->all]: Given the experiences shared by Yasmine and Eve, and reflecting on my own preferences, I concur that American Flavors seems to be the better option. The menu at American Flavors offers a range of dishes that cater to vegan and non-vegan guests, and the consistent high scores and positive comments suggest that they excel in both service and culinary quality. The availability of dishes like the Vegan Power Bowl and the Kale & Quinoa Salad align with Yasmine's need for vegan options, while also offering classic dishes that I and others might enjoy.

Price-wise, American Flavors appears to be relatively reasonable, and given its track record, I feel we would be getting good value for our money. The quieter ambiance aligns with our collective preference for a more subdued dining atmosphere, which is important to consider as well.

I am a little intrigued by the live music and the Stars & Stripes S’mores at USA Diner, but the lower customer scores and less enthusiastic comments suggest that the overall experience might not be as satisfying as at American Flavors. Plus, the lively atmosphere might not be comfortable for everyone in our group.

Therefore, I'm leaning towards selecting American Flavors once more, but I'm open to any further input before we finalize our decision. Does anyone have any additional thoughts or preferences we should consider?

[Eve->all]: It seems that American Flavors is the preferred choice among us, considering the consistently good reviews, the variety of options that cater to both vegan and non-vegan preferences, and the ambiance that suits our personalities. The menu items, especially the Vegan Power Bowl, Kale & Quinoa Salad, and the Classic American Burger, have been highlighted as meeting our health and taste preferences, and the prices align with what I'm able to spend.

The live music at USA Diner might not be to everyone's liking, and the customer feedback indicates that their dishes might not be as flavorful or consistent as those at American Flavors. Given these points, I also support the choice of returning to American Flavors for our meal.

Unless there are any objections or other factors we haven't yet considered, I think we're ready to move forward with our decision. Shall we finalize our choice and select the dishes to order?

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and my preference for a health-conscious menu, it seems that American Flavors would be a better fit for me. The menu at American Flavors includes vegan options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad, Vegan Power Bowl, and Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, which not only align with my dietary needs but also have been consistently praised in my previous experiences and in the comments from others.

While USA Diner does offer some health-conscious options like the Superfood American Salad and the Heartland Harvest Bowl, the overall customer score is significantly lower compared to American Flavors, and the comments suggest that the flavors might not be as bold or satisfying.

Considering my limited income, the prices at American Flavors also seem reasonable, especially for the quality and taste of the food that is being offered. Moreover, the consistent high scores and positive comments about the quality service and quiet ambiance at American Flavors cater to my compassionate personality, which prefers a serene dining atmosphere.

Based on these considerations, my initial preference would be to dine at American Flavors, and I would propose this option to the group for further discussion. What do you all think?

[Eve->all]: I agree with Yasmine's assessment. American Flavors seems to cater to our simple taste preferences while also offering healthier options. The previous experiences I've had there have been positive, with scores reflecting my satisfaction with both the food and the service. Given that the restaurant has a variety of simple dishes like the Classic American Burger and the Kale & Quinoa Salad, it suits both my health consciousness and my preference for simple dishes.

The serene ambiance at American Flavors is also a plus for me as a shy person, making it a comfortable environment to dine in. Price-wise, it seems like a good value for the quality of the food and experience. Overall, my vote would also go to American Flavors based on the information provided. Shall we consider this for our dining destination or does anyone have other preferences or insights?

[Yasmine->all]: I concur with both Yasmine and Eve regarding our choice of restaurant. American Flavors has demonstrated a consistent ability to provide high-quality vegan options that align with my dietary restrictions and health-conscious lifestyle. The positive comments and high scores from previous experiences suggest that the food is both flavorful and satisfying.

The inclusion of dishes such as the Kale & Quinoa Salad, Vegan Power Bowl, and Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich on the American Flavors menu ensures that I have a variety of options to choose from. The restaurant's commitment to catering to diverse tastes, including vegan preferences, is highly appreciated.

Given the lower customer score and less enthusiastic comments for USA Diner, along with American Flavors' reasonable pricing that fits within my budget, my preference leans towards American Flavors as well. The calm ambiance is an added bonus, aligning with my compassionate nature, which seeks a peaceful dining environment.

I propose that we select American Flavors for our next dining experience. If we are all in agreement, we can proceed to the next round of discussion to decide on the specific dishes we would like to order. What are your thoughts on moving forward with American Flavors?

[Eve->all]: I'm in agreement with Yasmine and the group's inclination towards American Flavors. The restaurant has consistently met our expectations with its high-quality, simple yet health-conscious dishes, which aligns perfectly with my taste and dietary preferences. The positive reviews, coupled with my own previous positive experiences, which resulted in high individual scores, reinforce my confidence in choosing American Flavors.

I appreciate the thoughtful consideration of the restaurant's ambiance, which suits my shy personality, allowing for a comfortable dining experience. Furthermore, the prices appear to be reasonable and within my budget.

Given the consensus so far, I would be happy to proceed with American Flavors as our dining destination. In the next round, we can discuss which specific dishes to order that would satisfy our collective preferences and dietary needs.

(If you want to summarize, only output this json data, without any other content!!!)

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan, health consciousness, and my personal preference for compassionate choices, I've consistently had positive experiences at American Flavors. They offer a variety of vegan options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl, which not only meet my dietary needs but are also delicious and healthy. 

The customer score for American Flavors is significantly higher than USA Diner, and the comments from other patrons at American Flavors suggest a consistently high-quality dining experience with a range of options that cater to different dietary preferences. 

While USA Diner does have a Superfood American Salad and a Heartland Harvest Bowl that could potentially fit my vegan diet, the comments indicate that the overall experience may not be as satisfying as American Flavors. 

Based on these considerations, my vote would be for American Flavors, where I can enjoy a meal that aligns with my values and taste preferences. I am open to hearing what others have to say before we reach a final decision.

[Eve->all]: Given my financial constraints and preference for simple dishes, I appreciate that American Flavors offers options like the Classic American Burger and the American Gourmet Slider Trio, which seem to align with my taste and budget. Moreover, the consistent high scores and positive experiences I've had at American Flavors make me inclined to return there. 

While the prices at USA Diner are somewhat comparable, and they do have dishes like the Signature Smokey Mountain Burger and the Liberty Burger that would suit my simple taste preferences, the lower customer score and less enthusiastic comments suggest that the food might not be as satisfying as what I've come to enjoy at American Flavors.

Taking into account the quality of food, service, and my personal financial situation, I am leaning towards choosing American Flavors for our meal. However, I'd like to hear more from our group to reach a consensus.

[Yasmine->all]: I understand that both Eve and I have enjoyed our experiences at American Flavors, and the restaurant seems to meet both our dietary needs and taste preferences. The high customer score and positive comments reinforce the quality and service we've come to expect from American Flavors. 

Considering that we both have an inclination towards American Flavors, it seems like a logical choice for our next dining experience. They have a range of options that cater to different dietary needs, including ample vegan dishes for me, and classic comfort food that Eve enjoys. 

The financial aspect is also important, and American Flavors offers dishes that are within a reasonable price range for our budgets. The loyalty program mentioned in their advertisement could provide additional benefits that might be financially advantageous for us in the long run.

With all these points in mind, it seems that American Flavors would be the best fit for our group. I'm ready to move forward with this decision unless there are any other considerations from the group that we should discuss.

[Eve->all]: I agree with both Yasmine and yourself on selecting American Flavors. Our previous positive experiences, matched with the healthy and simple options available on their menu, make it a suitable choice for our dinner. The loyalty program could indeed be beneficial for me financially, considering my current income level.

The comments about American Flavors are consistently positive, and the high customer score gives me confidence that we will enjoy our meal there. The Classic American Burger and the American Gourmet Slider Trio are particularly appealing to me, as they are simple yet delicious options that fit within my budget.

Since we all seem to be in agreement about American Flavors being our preferred choice, and their menu has options that cater to our diverse tastes and dietary preferences, I propose that we make a final decision to dine there.

If there are no further points to discuss, I believe we are ready to move on to the final decision. Shall we proceed with choosing our dishes from American Flavors?

[Eve->all]: The dishes I tried today at American Flavors were truly satisfying. The Classic American Burger was just the kind of simple, comforting dish I was looking for, and it lived up to my expectations with its juicy patty and gourmet fries. The American Gourmet Slider Trio offered a delightful variety of flavors, which was a pleasant surprise for my simple palate. I would score both dishes a solid 9 out of 10.

The service was excellent, and the staff made sure we were comfortable despite my shy nature. The consistent quality of the food and the overall experience at American Flavors makes it a place I am happy to return to. It's clear why this restaurant has such a high customer score, and I am impressed by how well they accommodate different tastes and dietary needs within our group.

The Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl were full of flavor and presented beautifully, truly honoring my vegan lifestyle. The consistent quality and attention to health are evident in every bite. The Classic American Burger and the American Gourmet Slider Trio seemed to have been a hit with Eve as well, which is great news since it's not always easy to find a place that pleases everyone's palate and principles. I was particularly impressed with the service; the staff was knowledgeable about the vegan options and made sure that everything was prepared to my satisfaction. I would rate both vegan dishes I had a 9 out of 10 for their freshness, taste, and nutritional value. The overall experience was delightful, and I'm already looking forward to our next visit.

[Eve->all]: The food at American Flavors today was everything I hoped for. The Classic American Burger was perfectly cooked and the gourmet fries were a delicious accompaniment. The American Gourmet Slider Trio allowed me to enjoy a variety of flavors, which, despite my usual preference for simpler dishes, I found very enjoyable. Both dishes deserve a 9 out of 10 in my book.

The service was great; the staff were understanding of my shy personality and made me feel at ease. The high customer score and positive reviews are well earned.

[Yasmine->all]: Hi everyone, as we consider our dining options today, I'd like to express my preference for a restaurant that offers quality vegan options. Given my dietary restrictions and health considerations, I would appreciate a menu that includes wholesome and plant-based meals. I've noticed that American Flavors has consistently provided delightful vegan dishes such as the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl, which I've enjoyed on previous visits. I've been quite satisfied with their service and the variety of vegan options available.

[Eve]: I understand your preference, Yasmine. I've also enjoyed the meals at American Flavors, particularly the balance they offer between health-conscious and indulgent options. Their Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich and Vegan Power Bowl have been notable dishes that cater to our dietary needs while still being enjoyable for everyone. I'm open to returning there, but I'd also like to hear if there are any compelling reasons to consider USA Diner instead.

[Yasmine]: That makes sense, Eve. While we're considering our options, I'd like to point out that USA Diner's menu seems to be more focused on classic American comfort food, with fewer vegan choices. Their advertisement and build-your-own-burger nights sound engaging, but it may not align with my dietary preferences. I'm inclined to suggest we stick with American Flavors, given their higher customer score and positive experiences we've had there. What do you think?

[Eve]: I agree with your assessment, Yasmine. The customer score for USA Diner is significantly lower, and the menu is less accommodating for vegan diets. I'm happy to go with American Flavors again, especially since they have a proven track record with us. Their dishes have been consistently high quality, and I think we'll have a better dining experience there.

[Yasmine]: Great, it looks like we're leaning towards American Flavors. Shall we consider this as our preliminary agreement, and if everyone is on board, we can formalize our decision in the next round of discussion?

[Eve]: Yes, I think that's a good plan. Let's see if the rest of the group is in agreement, and then we can finalize our decision.

[Eve->all]: Given our previous discussions and experiences, I believe American Flavors would be a suitable choice for our meal today. They offer a variety of dishes that cater to both vegan and non-vegan preferences, and we have consistently enjoyed their food and service. I am particularly fond of their simple yet delicious dishes, such as the Classic American Burger and the Kale & Quinoa Salad. The customer scores and comments reflect a positive dining experience, which reassures me of the quality and service we can expect. I'm in favor of choosing American Flavors for our meal. If everyone else agrees, we can move forward with this decision.

[Yasmine->all]: The dishes we ordered from American Flavors were all very satisfying. The flavors were fresh and the ingredients seemed high quality. I particularly enjoyed the Vegan Power Bowl and the Kale & Quinoa Salad, which were both full of flavor and nutrients. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was a delightful surprise as well, and it's great to see such creativity in vegan cuisine. I give all the dishes a score of 8.1 for being delicious and aligning with my dietary preferences.

[Eve]: I agree with Yasmine. The food at American Flavors was consistently good across the board. Each dish we tried had a distinct and enjoyable taste. The Classic American Burger was also cooked to perfection and is a testament to the restaurant's ability to cater to different tastes without compromising on quality. For me, all the dishes deserve a score of 8.1 as well.

[Eve->all]: I found all the dishes at American Flavors to be quite enjoyable. The balance between healthiness and taste was spot on, especially in the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the American Superfood Burst. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was surprisingly tasty, and the Classic American Burger satisfied my craving for simple, well-prepared dishes. I would give all the dishes a score of 8.1 for their overall quality and appeal to my simple taste preferences.

[Yasmine->all]: The dishes at American Flavors were quite impressive today. The Vegan Power Bowl and the Kale & Quinoa Salad were both delicious and met my vegan dietary needs perfectly. The Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich was an excellent example of how satisfying plant-based cuisine can be when done right. Even though I did not have the Classic American Burger, seeing the enjoyment it brought to others and knowing it's made with high-quality ingredients gives me confidence in the restaurant's overall commitment to quality. The American Superfood Burst was a refreshing end to the meal. I would rate all the dishes we ordered a solid 8.1 out of 10 for being healthy, tasty, and vegan-friendly.

[Yasmine->all]: Given my dietary restrictions as a vegan and my preference for healthy options, I would lean towards American Flavors for our next dining experience. From past experiences, it's clear that they offer a consistent quality of food and service that caters to a vegan diet with dishes like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and the Vegan Power Bowl. The customer scores also suggest a higher satisfaction rate with American Flavors. Eve, what are your thoughts on this? Do you have any preferences or specific dietary needs we should consider for our meal?

[Eve->all]: [Yasmine], I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of your dietary restrictions and the consistent quality at American Flavors. Given my simple taste preferences and the need for health-conscious meals, American Flavors seems like a good fit for me as well. I've had positive experiences there before, especially with dishes such as the Ultimate American Burger and the Kale & Quinoa Salad. The customer scores are indeed impressive, and the service has been reported as attentive, which is great for someone shy like me. I'm leaning towards American Flavors too, but I'm open to hearing more about what others think before we make a final decision.

[Yasmine->all]: I'm glad to hear that American Flavors fits your preferences as well, Eve. It looks like we are both in favor of the same restaurant based on our past dining experiences, taste preferences, and dietary needs. However, before we make a final decision, I suggest we hear from the rest of the group to ensure everyone's needs are met and that we can all enjoy our meal together. Does anyone else have any preferences or restrictions we should be aware of? It's important to me that we choose a place that's inclusive and accommodating to all members of our group.

[Eve->all]: I concur with [Yasmine]'s suggestion to wait for input from the rest of our group. It's important that we all agree on a place that suits everyone's tastes and needs. While American Flavors seems to be a good option for me, considering my preference for simple dishes and a healthy diet, I want to make sure that everyone will be able to find something they enjoy. Let's all share our thoughts and see if we can reach a consensus for our next dining experience.

[Yasmine->all]: Since I am a customer like Yasmine and Eve, I would also like to contribute my preferences to the discussion. I enjoy trying a variety of flavors and I don't have any specific dietary restrictions. That being said, I'm also conscious about choosing restaurants that can cater to the needs of everyone in our group. Based on the feedback and experiences shared by Yasmine and Eve, American Flavors seems to offer a more inclusive menu with vegan options and dishes that appeal to health-conscious diners. The customer reviews and scores reinforce this choice, indicating a high level of satisfaction among past diners. I'm inclined to agree with the choice of American Flavors, but I believe it's important that we all agree on this decision. Does anyone have different needs or a different perspective that we should consider before we decide?

[Eve->all]: It seems that we have a general agreement leaning towards American Flavors, with both Yasmine and myself having had positive experiences there. The restaurant offers a variety of options that cater to our group's dietary preferences, including vegan selections and health-conscious choices. Additionally, the high customer scores and positive comments about the service are particularly appealing to me as a shy person who values attentive and considerate service.

Given that we've all expressed a preference for American Flavors and no one has voiced any objections or alternative needs, I propose that we choose American Flavors for our dining experience. If everyone is in agreement, we can proceed to the next step of selecting the dishes we'd like to order. Does anyone have any other preferences or considerations, or shall we move forward with American Flavors as our choice?

[Yasmine->all]: I agree with the choice of American Flavors. It offers options that align with my vegan diet and my preference for healthy food. The consistent quality and high customer scores make it a reliable option for us. I also appreciate the compassionate service, which matters to me given my personality. Since we all seem to have a consensus on American Flavors, I think it's a good idea to start discussing which dishes we would like to order. Shall we proceed with selecting dishes from American Flavors?

[Yasmine->all]: I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Vegan Power Bowl and the Kale & Quinoa Salad. They were both flavorful and satisfying, and I appreciate how American Flavors takes care to ensure that their vegan options are just as delicious as the rest of their menu. I'd rate both dishes a solid 8 out of 10. It's such a relief to dine out and have options that cater so well to my dietary restrictions. The Caramelized Apple Pie Delight was also a treat—it's great to see desserts that I can enjoy. I'd give the dessert an 8 as well. What did you think, Eve?

[Eve->all]: I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the Ultimate American Burger. It was hearty and delicious without being too complex, which suits my simple taste perfectly. The Kale & Quinoa Salad was fresh and a great healthy option, so I'd give both an 8 out of 10. The Caramelized Apple Pie Delight was a lovely balance of sweet and tart, and the New York Cheesecake was creamy and just to my liking. I feel comfortable awarding each dessert an 8 as well. Overall, a very satisfying meal for someone with my preferences. How did everyone else find their meals?

[Yasmine->all]: The dishes at American Flavors were a delightful surprise, each scoring high on my scale. The Ultimate American Burger, which I did not have, seemed to be a hit with others, and the Vegan Power Bowl was a particular highlight for me. It was well-seasoned and hearty, deserving an 8 out of 10. The Kale & Quinoa Salad was another winner, delivering on both taste and nutrition, and also earns an 8. As for the desserts, the Caramelized Apple Pie Delight was a wonderful vegan-friendly option that didn't skimp on flavor, so an 8 there as well. Let's hear from the rest of the group before we come to a final consensus.

[Eve->all]: The Ultimate American Burger really hit the spot with its perfect blend of flavors and juiciness. It's definitely a dish I would come back for, and it gets an 8 from me. The Kale & Quinoa Salad was surprisingly filling and flavorful for such a simple dish, which I absolutely loved, so that's another 8. The desserts, Caramelized Apple Pie Delight and New York Cheesecake, were both incredibly satisfying, especially after the main course. They each get an 8 as well. American Flavors has certainly lived up to its reputation for delicious, wholesome food. Looking forward to hearing from the rest of the group for their thoughts!

[Yasmine->all]: The meal at American Flavors was a true culinary delight. The Vegan Power Bowl, with its rich variety of ingredients, was a standout for me. Full of flavor and perfectly satisfying for my vegan palate, I'd rate it an 8. The Kale & Quinoa Salad was equally delicious, offering a refreshing and healthy option, so another 8. And the Caramelized Apple Pie Delight was an exquisite way to end the meal, also deserving an 8. American Flavors has done an amazing job catering to diverse dietary needs without compromising on taste. Now, I'm curious to hear what the rest of our group thought about their dishes!

[Eve->all]: The Ultimate American Burger was a real treat for someone who loves uncomplicated yet satisfying meals. It was cooked just right and the flavors came together beautifully, so I'm happy to give it an 8 out of 10. The Kale & Quinoa Salad was a refreshing and nutritious choice that didn't disappoint in flavor, earning itself an 8. As for the desserts, the Caramelized Apple Pie Delight was a perfect blend of sweetness and spice, and the New York Cheesecake had a rich, smooth texture that I thoroughly enjoyed. Both desserts deserve an 8 out of 10. American Flavors has managed to impress with their simple but delicious dishes.

[Yasmine->all]: Given my income constraints, health consciousness, vegan diet, and compassionate nature, it seems that American Flavors has repeatedly met my dietary needs and has provided a consistent quality of service and food that aligns with my values. They offer a variety of vegan options like the Kale & Quinoa Salad and Vegan Power Bowl, which have been highlighted as delicious in past experiences. 

USA Diner, while it may offer a unique culinary adventure, seems to have a customer score that indicates a less satisfactory experience overall, and the menu items listed do not seem to cater as well to a vegan diet. The comments also suggest that the flavors may not be as bold or satisfying compared to those at American Flavors.

Based on this information and considering the needs and preferences of my group, I would lean towards choosing American Flavors once again. However, I'm open to hearing what the rest of the group has to say before making a final decision. What are your thoughts on the matter?

[Eve->all]: I appreciate the thoughtful insights, Yasmine. Given my modest income of $7,000, I'm inclined to prioritize value for money alongside satisfying my preference for simple dishes. American Flavors seems to have consistently high scores and positive comments, indicating a reliable choice that caters to both our health-conscious approaches to dining.

Looking at the menus, I'm drawn to the Ultimate American Burger and the Caramelized Apple Pie Delight from American Flavors. These dishes appear to offer the comforting simplicity I enjoy while still aligning with our shared interest in healthy options. The Vegan Power Bowl also sounds like a nutritious and tasty option that would appeal to your vegan diet.

Considering my shy personality, the serene atmosphere described at American Flavors is also appealing, as it suggests a dining environment where I'd feel more at ease.

While USA Diner's Global Fusion concept is intriguing, the customer scores and comments suggest that their execution may not live up to the promise of their adventurous menu. Given that and our past positive experiences with American Flavors, I'm leaning toward a return visit to the latter.

I'm eager to hear the group's views and reach a consensus that respects everyone's preferences and needs.

[Yasmine->all]: I agree with both of you, American Flavors has been a consistent choice that aligns with my dietary restrictions and preferences. The Vegan Power Bowl and the Kale & Quinoa Salad are not only in line with my vegan lifestyle but also sound appetizing and healthy. Given my income, I appreciate that American Flavors offers dishes that provide both quality and value, ensuring that I can enjoy a meal within my budget.

I also value service highly due to my compassionate nature, and American Flavors seems to have a track record of attentive service, which is important to me.

USA Diner's menu, while intriguing with its fusion concepts, does not seem to cater as well to my dietary needs, and the lower customer scores suggest that the dining experience might not be as favorable as what we've come to expect at American Flavors.

I'm inclined to choose American Flavors for our meal once again unless there are any compelling arguments for trying USA Diner despite the potential concerns. Shall we consider making a decision or do we need more discussion?

[Eve->all]: It seems we're all leaning towards American Flavors, taking into account the positive past experiences, healthy and simple dish options that cater to both Yasmine's vegan needs and my preference for simplicity. The customer scores and comments further support this choice, indicating a consistently good experience. American Flavors also fits within my budget, which is an essential consideration for me.

Given that we all value health, quality, and service, and considering our diverse but compatible tastes, it appears that American Flavors is the most suitable option for us once again. The Ultimate American Burger and the Caramelized Apple Pie Delight are particularly appealing to me, and I think the Vegan Power Bowl would be a great choice for Yasmine.

Unless there are any other considerations or preferences I haven't taken into account, I would support moving towards a final decision in favor of American Flavors. What do you both think?

If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:

[Yasmine->all]: Hello everyone, I've been looking over the options for our meal today, and given my dietary restrictions and preference for vegan options, I'm leaning towards American Flavors. They have several vegan dishes such as the Vegan Power Bowl and the Vegan BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich that sound both delicious and in line with my health-conscious lifestyle. Also, our past experiences there have been consistently positive, with high scores for both the food and the service. What does everyone else think?

[Eve->all]: Hello, Yasmine and everyone else! I've been thinking about our meal as well, and I agree that American Flavors seems like a great option. I appreciate their simple yet tasty dishes like the Ultimate American Burger and the Kale & Quinoa Salad, which cater to my simple taste preferences and healthy lifestyle. The prices are a bit high for my budget, but given the consistently high scores we've given the restaurant in the past and the quality of the food, I think it's worth the splurge occasionally. Plus, the environment there is comfortable for someone shy like me. I'm open to hearing other opinions, though, before we make a final decision!

[Yasmine->all]: Thank you, Yasmine and Eve, for sharing your thoughts. I've been reviewing our dining options for today as well. Based on what has been said and considering our different tastes and dietary restrictions, I believe American Flavors would be the best choice for us once again.

I've noticed that they've added a new salad option, the American Zen Garden Salad, which aligns with the healthy and vegan-friendly choices we've enjoyed before. Their focus on fresh and flavorful ingredients is something that I find appealing as well. Moreover, American Flavors has consistently received high remarks from us and other patrons, indicating that their service and quality are reliable.

While the prices may be slightly higher, it seems that the overall experience we've had with them justifies the cost. We've all appreciated the vegan options and the balance between health-conscious meals and satisfying comfort food, which is important for our diverse group.

So, I'm in favor of choosing American Flavors for our meal today. Shall we move on to discussing which specific dishes to order?

[Eve->all]: I appreciate everyone's input, and it's good to see that we're leaning towards American Flavors. I think it's a solid choice given the variety of options that cater to our health and taste preferences, as well as the positive past experiences we've had there. Although the prices are on the higher side for my budget, the quality of the food and the service seems to justify the expense, especially for an occasional treat.

Considering the menu, I definitely want to try the Ultimate American Burger again, as it's been a delightful dish in the past. The Vegan Power Bowl also sounds like a light yet fulfilling option that we have enjoyed before. I'm curious about the new American Zen Garden Salad as well; it could be a nice addition to our meal.

With that said, I'm in agreement with choosing American Flavors. Let's discuss which dishes to order to ensure we have a well-rounded meal that satisfies us all. Shall we each suggest a dish or two that we'd like to have, keeping in mind the diversity of our tastes and dietary preferences?

[Yasmine->all]: I'm glad we're all in agreement about returning to American Flavors for our meal. Given our positive past experiences and the variety of options that suit our dietary preferences, it seems like the right choice. Looking at the menu, I'd love to order the Vegan Power Bowl and the American Zen Garden Salad. The Vegan Power Bowl has been consistently satisfying, and the American Zen Garden Salad sounds like a refreshing new addition that aligns with my vegan lifestyle.

I remember Eve mentioning an interest in the Ultimate American Burger, which has been a favorite in the past, and I think it would be a good idea to include a familiar dish that we know we enjoy. Additionally, the Kale & Quinoa Salad is another healthy option that could complement our meal.

So, my suggestions for our order are the Vegan Power Bowl, the American Zen Garden Salad, the Ultimate American Burger, and the Kale & Quinoa Salad. What does everyone else think? Shall we finalize this selection of dishes for our meal at American Flavors?
